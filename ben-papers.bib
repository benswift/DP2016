  abstract = {This essay introduces the work of controversial historian and philosopher of science and technology, Bruno Latour. It suggests that his theories of hybrid objects, his analyses of networks that criss-cross normally discrete categories of science, politics, and culture, and his displacement of the modern/postmodern paradigm can offer productive new readings of science fiction, permitting critics to rethink the genre's relation to science and society. Latour's own "scientifictions" (his coinage) are examined alongside works by sf authors China Mi\'{e}ville, Paul McAuley, and Kim Stanley Robinson., Technoculture and Science Fiction},

F\'{e}lix Guattari (1930-1992) was a psychoanalyst at the la Borde Clinic, as well as being a major social theorist and radical activist. A Thousand Plateaus is part of Deleuze and Guattari's landmark philosophical project, Capitalism and Schizophrenia {\textendash} a project that still sets the terms of contemporary philosophical debate. A Thousand Plateaus provides a compelling analysis of social phenomena and offers fresh alternatives for thinking about philosophy and culture. Its radical perspective provides a toolbox for `nomadic thought' and has had a galvanizing influence on today's anti-capitalist movement. Translated by Brian Massumi\ensuremath{>}},

  abstract = {Our goal is to estimate causal interactions in multivariate time series. Using vector autoregressive (VAR) models, these can be defined based on non-vanishing coefficients belonging to respective time-lagged instances. As in most cases a parsimonious causality structure is assumed, a promising approach to causal discovery consists in fitting VAR models with an additional sparsity-promoting regularization. Along this line we here propose that sparsity should be enforced for the subgroups of coefficients that belong to each pair of time series, as the absence of a causal relation requires the coefficients for all time-lags to become jointly zero. Such behavior can be achieved by means of l1-l2-norm regularized regression, for which an efficient active set solver has been proposed recently. Our method is shown to outperform standard methods in recovering simulated causality graphs. The results are on par with a second novel approach which uses multiple statistical testing.

  title = {Interactive {Technologies} as {Fields} of {Transduction}},
  abstract = {This article proposes a critical inquiry of interactive environments as fields of transduction. It is argued that Gilbert Simondon's concepts of individuation, transduction, in-formation, the preindividual, and the associated milieu enable a processual thinking of the analysis and design of interactive technologies as technogenetic emergence. These concepts offer a way for interaction design to understand interactive environments through the dynamics between fields of transduction and fields of experience in relational and affective terms. The article analyses the way in which two technological assemblages, Voz Alta and the Impossible Room, provide different experiential fields experimenting with the transductive power of digital and interactive media. We emphasise the potential for creating new modes of experience. Our aim is to underline the necessary convergences between practices of design and thought; to enable affectively engaging fields of transduction.},

Two examples of this form of analysis are shown: the installation piece Deus Oculi; and Stelare's Ping Body performance piece. The analysis of these pieces renders visible the varied (re)mappings of the causal nature of interaction, direct and indirect effects, and how these are perceived and exploited by the various members of performance social groupings. Our aim, then, is to provide a model that can be used to explore the relationships that exist in performative activities across domains.},

As the system is able to identify and update the state of many (30 or more) tags simultaneously, they can be used together in any combination-e.g., several can sit on a surface at fixed distances from the reader while others can be handheld or worn by a single user or multiple performers. This interface is able to detect both free gesture (position and orientation of the objects) as well as local or tactile variables (e.g., pressure). We describe a series of controllers that exploit the musical possibilities of this architecture-the somewhat constrained Musical Trinkets, where objects were tied to simple notes and musical effects, and its successor, the Musical Navigatrics, which enabled dynamic overdubbing and control of complex musical sequences and sonic textures. We close with a description of a very simple and inexpensive actively-tagged tracking system capable of much wider range.},

  url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1103.5189v1},
  abstract = {Financial data has been extensively studied for correlations using Pearson's cross-correlation coefficient \{{\textbackslash}rho\} as the point of departure. We employ an estimator based on recurrence plots --- the Correlation of Probability of Recurrence (CPR) --- to analyze connections between nine stock indices spread worldwide. We suggest a slight modification of the CPR approach in order to get more robust results. We examine trends in CPR for an approximately 19-month window moved along the time series and compare them to \{{\textbackslash}rho\}. Binning CPR into three levels of connectedness: strong, moderate and weak, we extract the trends in number of connections in each bin over time. We also look at the behavior of CPR during the Dot-Com bubble by shifting the time series to align their peaks. CPR mainly uncovers that the markets move in and out of periods of strong connectivity erratically, instead of moving monotonously towards increasing global connectivity. This is in contrast to \{{\textbackslash}rho\}, which gives a picture of ever increasing correlation. CPR also exhibits that time shifted markets have high connectivity around the Dot-Com bubble of 2000. We stress on the importance of significance testing in interpreting measures applied to field data. CPR is more robust to significance testing. It has the additional advantages of being robust to noise, and reliable for short time series lengths and low frequency of sampling. Further, it is more sensitive to changes than \{{\textbackslash}rho\} as it captures correlations between the essential dynamics of the underlying systems.},

While some of these criticisms are well-founded, frequently the use of various parametric methods such as analysis of variance, regression, correlation are faulted because: (a) the sample size is too small, (b) the data may not be normally distributed, or (c) The data are from Likert scales, which are ordinal, so parametric statistics cannot be used. In this paper, I dissect these arguments, and show that many studies, dating back to the 1930s consistently show that parametric statistics are robust with respect to violations of these assumptions. Hence, challenges like those above are unfounded, and parametric methods can be utilized without concern for "getting the wrong answer".},

Research on visual working memory and the perception of coherent images in ambiguous figures supports this view. To test the relationship between perceptual consciousness and gamma synchrony, we recorded electroencephalogram activity while participants were presented with rivalling visual images to each eye. Participants pressed buttons to indicate which image they were perceiving, and response-locked phase-locking values (6-60 Hz) were calculated from the electroencephalogram time series. Results revealed transient bursts of increased global phase synchrony in the gamma-band peaking approximately 425 and approximately 260 ms preresponse. This suggests that global gamma synchrony is associated with the emergence of a coherent conscious percept.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes an approach for reducing the computational complexity of a model-predictive-control strategy for discrete-time hybrid systems with discrete inputs only. Existing solutions are based on dynamic programming and multi-parametric programming approaches, while the one proposed in this paper is based on a modified version of performance-driven reachability analyses. The algorithm abstracts the behaviour of the hybrid system by building a 'tree of evolution'. The nodes of the tree represent the reachable states of a process, and the branches correspond to input combinations leading to designated states. A cost-function value is associated with each node and based on this value the exploration of the tree is driven. For any initial state, an input sequence is thus obtained, driving the system optimally over a finite horizon. According to the model predictive strategy, only the first input is actually applied to the system. The number of possible discrete input combinations is finite and the feasible set of the states of the system may be partitioned according to the optimization results. In the proposed approach, the partitioning is performed offline and a probabilistic neural network (PNN) is then trained by the set of points at the borders of the state-space partitions. The trained PNN is used as a system-state-based control-law classifier. Thus, the online computational effort is minimized and the control can be implemented in real time.},

Although there exist time domain approaches for the analysis of categorical time series such as Markov chains or link function based regression models, there is apparently little statistical theory of methodology for analyzing qualitative-valued time series in the frequency domain. The purpose of this paper is to initiate the development of a general framework for the frequency domain analysis of categorical time series. In doing so, we discuss the scaling of categorical time series and introduce a new concept that we call the spectral envelope of a categorical time series. We demonstrate our methodology on a data set from a problem in molecular biology.},

  doi = {10.1109/MS.2012.107},
  abstract = {To put the concept of lean software development in context, it's useful to point out similarities and differences with agile software development. Agile development methods have generally expected system architecture and interaction design to occur outside the development team, or to occur in very small increments within the team. Because of this, agile practices often prove to be insufficient in addressing issues of solution design, user interaction design, and high-level system architecture. Increasingly, agile development practices are being thought of as good ways to organize software development, but insufficient ways to address design. Because design is fundamentally iterative and development is fundamentally iterative, the two disciplines suffer if they are not carefully integrated with each other. Because lean development lays out a set of principles that demand a whole-product, complete life-cycle, cross-functional approach, it's the more likely candidate to guide the combination of design, development, deployment, and validation into a single feedback loop focused on the discovery and delivery of value.

They add new dimensions to input possibilities compared with traditional single-pointer devices. At the same time, complexity of input interpretation increases, as well. Particularly recognition of predefined gestures requires sophisticated techniques to cope with multiple points of interaction. In this paper we present a novel approach for recognition of multi-touch gestures by means of a mathematical rule calculus. It allows abstract definition of multi-touch gestures. We further outline how to implement a framework to encapsulate the recognition algorithm, and demonstrate its success through a practical example obtained from an existing application.},

In this paper, statistical pattern recognition techniques are utilized to tackle the problem in the context of solo musical phrases. Ten instrument classes from different instrument families are considered. A large sound database is collected from excerpts of musical phrases acquired from commercial recordings translating different instrument instances, performers, and recording conditions. More than 150 signal processing features are studied including new descriptors. Two feature selection techniques, inertia ratio maximization with feature space projection and genetic algorithms are considered in a class pairwise manner whereby the most relevant features are fetched for each instrument pair. For the classification task, experimental results are provided using Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) and support vector machines (SVMs). It is shown that higher recognition rates can be reached with pairwise optimized subsets of features in association with SVM classification using a radial basis function kernel},

  abstract = {Is Science Multicultural? explores what the last three decades of European/American, feminist, and postcolonial science and technology studies can learn from each other. Sandra Harding introduces and discusses an array of postcolonial science studies, and their implications for "northern" science. All three science studies strains have developed in the context of post-World War II science and technology projects. They illustrate how technoscientific projects mean different things to different groups. The meaning attached by the culture of the West may not be shared or may be diametrically opposite in the cultures in other parts of the world. All, however, would agree that scientific projects{\textemdash}modern science included{\textemdash}are "local knowledge systems." The interests and discursive resources that the various science studies bring groups to their projects, and the ways that they organize the production of their kind of science studies, are distinctively culturally-local also. While their projects may be unintentionally converging, they also conflict in fundamental respects.How is this inevitable cultural-situatedness of knowledge both an invaluable resource as well as a limitation on the advance of knowledge about nature? What are the distinctive resources that the feminist and postcolonial science theorists offer in thinking about the history of modern science; the diversity of "scientific" traditions in non-European as well as in European cultures; and the directions that might be taken by less androcentric and Eurocentric scientific projects? How might modern sciences' projects be linked more firmly to the prodemocratic yearnings that are so widely voiced in contemporary life? Carefully balancing poststructuralist and conventional epistemological resources, this study concludes by proposing new directions for thinking about objectivity, method, and reflexivity in light of the new understandings developed in the post-World War II world.},

  abstract = {In Technology as Experience, John McCarthy and Peter Wright argue that any account of what is often called the user experience must take into consideration the emotional, intellectual, and sensual aspects of our interactions with technology. We don't just use technology, they point out; we live with it. They offer a new approach to understanding human-computer interaction through examining the felt experience of technology. Drawing on the pragmatism of such philosophers as John Dewey and Mikhail Bakhtin, they provide a framework for a clearer analysis of technology as experience.Just as Dewey, in Art as Experience, argued that art is part of everyday lived experience and not isolated in a museum, McCarthy and Wright show how technology is deeply embedded in everyday life. The "zestful integration" or transcendent nature of the aesthetic experience, they say, is a model of what human experience with technology might become.McCarthy and Wright illustrate their theoretical framework with real-world examples that range from online shopping to ambulance dispatch. Their approach to understanding human computer interaction -- seeing it as creative, open, and relational, part of felt experience -- is a measure of the fullness of technology's potential to be more than merely functional.},

  abstract = {Large-scale scientific experiments based on computer simulations are typically modeled as scientific workflows, which eases the chaining of different programs. These scientific workflows are defined, executed, and monitored by scientific workflow management systems (SWfMS). As these experiments manage large amounts of data, it becomes critical to execute them in high-performance computing environments, such as clusters, grids, and clouds. However, few SWfMS provide parallel support. The ones that do so are usually labor-intensive for workflow developers and have limited primitives to optimize workflow execution. To address these issues, we developed workflow algebra to specify and enable the optimization of parallel execution of scientific workflows. In this paper, we show how the workflow algebra is efficiently implemented in Chiron, an algebraic based parallel scientific workflow engine. Chiron has a unique native distributed provenance mechanism that enables runtime queries in a relational database. We developed two studies to evaluate the performance of our algebraic approach implemented in Chiron; the first study compares Chiron with different approaches, whereas the second one evaluates the scalability of Chiron. By analyzing the results, we conclude that Chiron is efficient in executing scientific workflows, with the benefits of declarative specification and runtime provenance support.

  abstract = {In this paper we show that both music composition and brain function, as revealed by the electroencephalogram (EEG) analysis, are renewal non-Poisson processes living in the nonergodic dominion. To reach this important conclusion we process the data with the minimum spanning tree method, so as to detect significant events, thereby building a sequence of times, which is the time series to analyze. Then we show that in both cases, EEG and music composition, these significant events are the signature of a non-Poisson renewal process. This conclusion is reached using a technique of statistical analysis recently developed by our group, the aging experiment (AE). First, we find that in both cases the distances between two consecutive events are described by nonexponential histograms, thereby proving the non-Poisson nature of these processes. The corresponding survival probabilities Psi(t) are well fitted by stretched exponentials {[}Psi(t) proportional, variant exp (-(gammat)\{alpha\}) , with 0.5},

  abstract = {It used to be that two laptops, sitting side by side, couldn't communicate with each other; they may as well have been a thousand miles apart. But that was then, before the advent of Zero Configuration Networking technology. This amazing cross-platform open source technology automatically connects electronic devices on a network, allowing them to interoperate seamlessly-without any user configuration. So now you don't have to lift a finger! Needless to say, it has completely changed the way people connect to devices and programs for printing, file sharing, and other activities.
Zero Configuration Networking: The Definitive Guide walks you through this groundbreaking network technology, with a complete description of the protocols and ways to implement network-aware applications and devices.
Written by two Zero Configuration Networking experts, including one of Apple's own computer scientists, the book covers more than just file sharing and printing. Zero Configuration Networking also enables activities such as music and photo sharing and automatic buddy discovery on Instant Messaging applications. In fact, Zero Configuration Networking can be used for virtually any device that can be controlled by a computer. And this handy guide has the inside scoop on all of its capabilities-and how you can easily apply them in your own environment. For the technically advanced, Zero Configuration Networking: The Definitive Guide examines the three core technologies that make up Zero Configuration Networking: Link-Local Addressing, Multicast DNS, and DNS Service Discovery. It also reviews a series of APIs, including C-API, Java API, CFNetServices, and Cocoa's NSNetServices. Whether you want to understand how iTunes works, or you want to network a series of laptops and other devices at your office for maximum efficiency, you'll find all the answers in this authoritative guide.},

While these taxonomies are an accurate representation of software visualization issues, they are somewhat skewed with respect to current research areas on software visualization. We revisit this important work and propose a number of re-alignments with respect to addressing the software engineering tasks of large-scale development and maintenance. We propose a framework to emphasize the general tasks of understanding and analysis during development and maintenance of large-scale software systems. Five dimensions relating to the what, where, how, who, and why of software visualization make up this framework. The focus of this work is not so much as to classify software visualization system, but to point out the need for matching the method with the task. Finally, a number of software visualization systems are examined under our framework to highlight the particular problems each addresses. View full abstract},

Multivariate electroencephalograph signals from 20 male subjects (ten musicians and ten non-musicians) were recorded while performing the mental rotation task and also at resting condition. Phase synchronization was measured by a recent index, mean phase coherence. It was found that synchronization between frontal cortex and right parietal cortex was significantly increased during mental rotation with respect to rest, whereby musicians showed significantly higher degrees of synchronization than non-musicians. Left hemispheric dominance in the degree of phase synchronization, stronger in the posterior right parietal and occipital regions, was observed in musicians. Right hemispheric dominance was generally observed in non-musicians.},

  abstract = {Based on the current context of the Sound and Music Computing (SMC) field, the state of the art in research and the open issues that have been identified and described in other articles of this journal issue, in this article we make a step forward and try to identify the broad SMC challenges and we propose strategies with which to tackle them. On the research side we identify a clear need for designing better sound objects and environments and for promoting research to understand, model, and improve human interaction with sound and music. In the education domain we feel the need for better training our multidisciplinary researchers and to make sure that they can contribute to the multicultural society we live in. There is also a clear need for improving the transferring of the knowledge and technologies generated by our community. Finally we claim that the SMC field should be very much concerned with its social context and that a number of current social concerns should be addressed. We accompany each of these challenges with strategies that should help researchers, educators and policy makers take specific actions to advance in the proposed SMC roadmap.},

In that issue, jazz was described as a process of improvising within a highly constrained structure and set of rules. Other genres of jazz, however, have gone beyond those constraints. Jazz improvisation has occurred within forms, with forms, and beyond forms. Perhaps organizational improvisation may as well.},

  doi = {10.1214/08-AOS610},
  abstract = {We formulate nonparametric and semiparametric hypothesis testing of multivariate stationary linear time series in a unified fashion and propose new test statistics based on estimators of the spectral density matrix. The limiting distributions of these test statistics under null hypotheses are always normal distributions, and they can be implemented easily for practical use. If null hypotheses are false, as the sample size goes to infinity, they diverge to infinity and consequently are consistent tests for any alternative. The approach can be applied to various null hypotheses such as the independence between the component series, the equality of the autocovariance functions or the autocorrelation functions of the component series, the separability of the covariance matrix function and the time reversibility. Furthermore, a null hypothesis with a nonlinear constraint like the conditional independence between the two series can be tested in the same way.

Along these lines, we present a system for remote human-in-the-loop grasp execution. An operator uses a computer interface to visualize a physical robot and its surroundings, and a point-and-click mouse interface to command the robot. We implemented and analyzed four different strategies for performing grasping tasks, ranging from direct, real-time operator control of the end-effector pose, to autonomous motion and grasp planning that is simply adjusted or confirmed by the operator. Our controlled experiment (N=48) results indicate that people were able to successfully grasp more objects and caused fewer unwanted collisions when using the strategies with more autonomous assistance. We used an untethered robot over wireless communications, making our strategies applicable for remote, human-in-the-loop robotic applications.},

Today, questions around the body are intrinsic to a wide range of debates - from technological developments in media and communications, to socio-cultural questions around representation, performance, class, race, gender and sexuality, to the more 'physical' concerns of health and illness, sleep, diet and eating disorders, body parts and the senses.

Workflow and most other computing tools typically distinguish batch from interactive operation. This distinction is ill-suited to scientific experimentation which typically starts interactively and then may progress to batch operation for larger or repeated runs of experiments. In this paper we present a scientific workflow model which unifies batch and interactive operation. This supports seamless experimentation by scientists. The model is implemented in a web based environment through the Microsoft Windows Workflow system and features a novel model for workflow components.},

  abstract = {Scientific workflows are commonly used to model and execute large-scale scientific experiments. They represent key resources for scientists and are managed by Scientific Workflow Management Systems (SWfMS). The different languages used by SWfMS may impact in the way the workflow engine executes the workflow, sometimes limiting optimization opportunities. To tackle this issue, we recently proposed a scientific workflow algebra {[}1{]}. This algebra is inspired by database relational algebra and it enables automatic optimization of scientific workflows to be executed in parallel in high performance computing (HPC) environments. This way, the experiments presented in this paper were executed in Chiron, a parallel scientific workflow engine implemented to support the scientific workflow algebra. Before executing the workflow, Chiron stores the prospective provenance {[}2{]} of the workflow on its provenance database. Each workflow is composed by several activities, and each activity consumes relations. Similarly to relational databases, a relation contains a set of attributes and it is composed by a set of tuples. Each tuple in a relation contains a series of values, each one associated to a specific attribute. The tuples of a relation are distributed to be consumed in parallel over the computing resources according to the workflow activity. During and after the execution, the retrospective provenance {[}2{]} is also stored.},

  abstract = {This article develops what Deleuze and Guattari call an assemblage around Debussy's L'Isle joyeuse in order to account for its signifying power in terms of territory, time, and desire. An assemblage is a multiplicity that territorializes natural, cultural, biological, and artistic phenomena in search of objectives that are fueled by desire. In this article, the assemblage around L'Isle joyeuse begins with a study of the interpretive aporias concerning time and place in Watteau's Le Pelerinage a l'Isle Cithere, a putative inspiration for Debussy's piano piece. After a discussion of the parallels between Watteau's Cythera paintings and Debussy's L'Isle joyeuse, the article turns to the problem of apotheosis in the latter work, using Chopin's Barcarolle as an intertext. The article turns next to Debussy's compatriot, Bergson, whose early philosophical writing conceives of time as duration, freed from spatial metaphors. From the Bergsonian perspective, we can hear Debussy's piano piece as a musical correlate to a conception of time far from the linearity of space. The article concludes with a discussion of Deleuze and Guattari's A Thousand Plateaus with particular emphasis on their ideas about chaos and ecstasy, illustrating how the desire and fulfillment in L'Isle joyeuse renew themselves as they participate in assemblages.},

In this study we have designed and built a stress sensor based on Galvanic Skin Response (GSR), and controlled by ZigBee. In order to check the device's performance, we have used 16 adults (eight women and eight men) who completed different tests requiring a certain degree of effort, such as mathematical operations or breathing deeply. On completion, we appreciated that GSR is able to detect the different states of each user with a success rate of 76.56\%. In the future, we plan to create an algorithm which is able to differentiate between each state.},

  abstract = {Brain correlates comparing pleasant and unpleasant states induced by three dissimilar masterpiece excerpts were obtained. Related emotional reactions to the music were studied using Principal Component Analysis of validated reports, fMRI, and EEG coherent activity. A piano selection by Bach and a symphonic passage from Mahler widely differing in musical features were used as pleasing pieces. A segment by Prodromid\`{e}s was used as an unpleasing stimulus. Ten consecutive 30 s segments of each piece alternating with random static noise were played to 19 non-musician volunteers for a total of 30 min of auditory stimulation. Both brain approaches identified a left cortical network involved with pleasant feelings (Bach and Mahler vs. Prodromid\`{e}s) including the left primary auditory area, posterior temporal, inferior parietal and prefrontal regions. While the primary auditory zone may provide an early affective quality, left cognitive areas may contribute to pleasant feelings when melodic sequences follow expected rules. In contrast, unpleasant emotions (Prodromid\`{e}s vs. Bach and Mahler) involved the activation of the right frontopolar and paralimbic areas. Left activation with pleasant and right with unpleasant musical feelings is consistent with right supremacy in novel situations and left in predictable processes. When all musical excerpts were jointly compared to noise, in addition to bilateral auditory activation, the left temporal pole, inferior frontal gyrus, and frontopolar area were activated suggesting that cognitive and language processes were recruited in general responses to music. Sensory and cognitive integration seems required for musical emotion.},

  abstract = {Although social scientists have long believed that mechanization degrades skills, they disagree on the meaning and measurement of skills. A dominant view stresses that capitalists simplify skills to increase efficiency and profits; another, that managers deskill jobs to increase control over workers and work organization. Although case studies document the disappearance of many crafts during the industrial transformation of Britain and the United States, they do not show that skills as a whole declined. Recent historical studies reveal that industrialization may have created as many new skills as it destroyed, that early manufacturing used many traditional skills, and that new industrial skills were genuine. They also show that scientific management deskilled workers slightly and that management successfully wrested control of work organization from the traditional crafts. Twentieth-century census data reveal little aggregate compositional change in the skill distribution of major occupations. Short-term studies of individual occupational skills show little or no aggregate change. Finally, case studies of automation suggest that its deskilling effects vary greatly by occupation and industry. Firm conclusions about skill degradation must await time-series analysis of national surveys that measure components of occupational skills in different industries.},

  abstract = {This collection of essays offers new perspectives on the Industrial Revolution as a global phenomenon. The fifteen contributors go beyond the longstanding view of industrialization as a linear process marked by discrete stages. Instead, they examine a lengthy and creative period in the history of industrialization, 1750 to 1914, reassessing the nature of and explanations for England's industrial primacy, and comparing significant industrial developments in countries ranging from China to Brazil. Each chapter explores a distinctive national production ecology, a complex blend of natural resources, demographic pressures, cultural impulses, technological assets, and commercial practices. At the same time, the chapters also reveal the portability of skilled workers and the permeability of political borders. The Industrial Revolution comes to life in discussions of British eagerness for stylish, middle-class products; the Enlightenment's contribution to European industrial growth; early America's incremental (rather than revolutionary) industrialization; the complex connections between Czarist and Stalinist periods of industrial change in Russia; Japan's late and rapid turn to mechanized production; and Brazil's industrial-financial boom. By exploring unique national patterns of industrialization as well as reciprocal exchanges and furtive borrowing among these states, the book refreshes the discussion of early industrial transformations and raises issues still relevant in today's era of globalization.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose a complementary technique called active code completion. When the developer invokes the code completion menu, the editor looks for a palette definition associated with the type of the expression being entered. If found, an option to use this palette is added to the code completion menu. When the developer selects this option, source code is not inserted immediately. Instead, the palette definition takes control of the code completion interface. The developer can then interact with this interface to provide parameters and other information related to her intent, and receive immediate feedback about the effect these choices will have on the object's behavior. When the developer indicates that she is satisfied with these choices, the palette generates code that is inserted at the cursor. View full abstract},

Live-coding practice accentuates the score, and whilst it is the perfect vehicle for the performance of algorithmic music it also transforms the compositional process itself into a live event. As a continuation of 20th-century artistic developments of the musical score, live-coding systems often embrace graphical elements and language syntaxes foreign to standard programming languages. The author presents live coding as a highly technologized artistic practice, shedding light on how non-linearity, play and generativity will become prominent in future creative media productions.},

  abstract = {Although IT has penetrated into nearly every aspect of the work and life of human beings, music professionals still stick to the traditional way of carrying out rehearsals and concerts. Music performance in this way requires physical presence of the participants and has a number of inherent limitations. We introduce in this paper a prototype of a novel networked music performance system that enables the music professionals and enthusiasts to play with each other through cyberspace. An application like this is bandwidth demanding, highly delay-sensitive and requires the synchronization of the audio streams. Hence, the support from underlying end-systems and networks is critical. However, the current source coding mechanisms and the best-effort nature of the Internet poses many challenges to achieve the desired quality of service. We have implemented the prototype in a local area network environment on Linux PCs. The system contains four major interactive components and enables two different application scenarios of real-time rehearsal and rehearsal on-demand multi-channel audio transport and different audio compression schemes are supported. Our evaluation results based on both subjective and objective measurements show that the system suffices the audio quality level for the target application. In the future, we extend our system to larger scale and consider more realistic network conditions in the Internet. Moreover, the support for MPEG-4 AAC codec for even better quality of multi-channel audio streaming and enhanced audio quality under the same bandwidth constrains are added. View full abstract},

  abstract = {We present a technique to facilitate the creation of constantly changing, randomized audio streams from samples of source material. A core motivation is to make it easier to quickly create soundscapes for virtual environments and other scenarios where long streams of audio are used. While mostly in the background, these streams are vital for the creation of mood and realism in these types of applications. Our approach is to extract the component parts of sampled audio signals, and use them to resynthesize a continuous audio stream of indeterminate length, An automatic segmentation algorithm involving wavelets is used to split the input signal into syllable-like audio segments that we call "natural grains." For each grain, a table of similarity between it and all the other grains is constructed. The grains are then output in a continuous stream, with the next grain being chosen from among those other grains which best follow from it. Using this sampling-resynthesis technique, we can construct an infinite number of variations on the original signal with a minimum amount of interaction. An inter-face for the manipulation and playback of several of these streams is provided to facilitate building complex audio environments, and is made available for online experimentation at www.cs.ubc.ca/labs/lci/naturalgrains/.},

But what if the most common beliefs about how creativity works are wrong? In this authoritative and fascinating new book, Keith Sawyer, a psychologist at Washington University, tears down some of the most popular myths about creativity and erects new principles in their place. He reveals that creativity is always collaborative-even when you're alone. (That ``eureka'' moment in the bathtub couldn't have come to Archimedes if he hadn't spent so many hours arguing and comparing notes with his fellow mathematicians and philosophers.) Sawyer draws on compelling stories of inventions and innovations: the inventors of the ATM, the mountain bike, and open source operating systems, among others, to demonstrate the freewheeling ways of true innovation. He shares the results of his own acclaimed research on jazz groups, theater ensembles, and conversation analysis, to show us how to be more creative in collaborative group settings, how to change organizational dynamics for the better, and how to tap into our own reserves of creativity.},

Implementations have side effects due to the implementing medium; these can account for several puzzles surrounding qualia. Finally, an argument for benign panpsychism is developed.},

The modeling of the accompaniment incorporates a number of distinct knowledge sources including timing information extracted in real-time from the soloist's acoustic signal, an understanding of the soloist's interpretation learned from rehearsals, and prior knowledge that guides the accompaniment toward musically plausible renditions. The solo and accompaniment parts are represented collectively as a large number of Gaussian random variables with a specified conditional independence structure--a Bayesian belief network. Within this framework a principled and computationally feasible method for generating real-time accompaniment is presented that incorporates the relevant knowledge sources. The EM algorithm is used to adapt the accompaniment to the soloist's interpretation through a series of rehearsals. A demonstration is provided from J. S. Bach's Cantata 12.},

Lucy Suchman argues that the planning model of interaction favoured by the majority of AI researchers does not take sufficient account of the situatedness of most human social behaviour. The problems that can arise as a result are pertinently, and often amusingly, illustrated by the careful analysis of a recorded interaction between novice users and an intelligent machine, whose design has failed to accommodate essential resources of successful human communication. Plans and Situated Actions presents a compelling case for the re-examination of current models underlying interface design. Lucy Suchman's proposals for a fresh characterisation of human-computer interaction which also incorporates recent insights from the social sciences provides a challenge that everyone interested in machine intelligence will seriously need to consider.},

  abstract = {Sonic Pi is a music live coding language that has been designed for educational use as a first programming language. However, it is not straightforward to achieve the necessary simplicity of a first language in a music live coding setting, for reasons largely related to the manipulation of time. The original version of Sonic Pi used a `sleep' function for managing time, blocking computation for a specified time period. However, while this approach was conceptually simple, it resulted in badly timed music, especially when multiple musical threads were executing concurrently. This paper describes an alternative programming approach for timing (implemented in Sonic Pi v2.0) which maintains syntactic compatibility with v1.0, yet provides accurate timing via interaction between real time and a "virtual time''. We provide a formal specification of the temporal behaviour of Sonic Pi, motivated in relation to other recent approaches to the semantics of time in live coding and general computation. We then define a monadic model of the Sonic Pi temporal semantics which is sound with respect to this specification, using Haskell as a metalanguage.},

We focus on three main sources of complexity, namely, the high dimensionality of the observed data, the dependencies between these observations, and the general nature of the noise model underlying their distribution. We investigate the recent Triplet Markov Fields and propose new models in this class designed for such data and in particular allowing very general noise models. In addition, our models can handle the inclusion of a learning step in a consistent way so that they can be used in a supervised framework. One advantage of our models is that whatever the initial complexity of the noise model, parameter estimation can be carried out using state-of-the-art Bayesian clustering techniques under the usual simplifying assumptions. As generative models, they can be seen as an alternative, in the supervised case, to discriminative Conditional Random Fields. Identifiability issues underlying the models in the nonsupervised case are discussed while the models performance is illustrated on simulated and real data, exhibiting the mentioned various sources of complexity.},

  abstract = {A landmark in jazz studies, Thinking in Jazz reveals as never before how musicians, both individually and collectively, learn to improvise. Chronicling leading musicians from their first encounters with jazz to the development of a unique improvisatory voice, Paul Berliner documents the lifetime of preparation that lies behind the skilled improviser's every idea.The product of more than fifteen years of immersion in the jazz world, Thinking in Jazz combines participant observation with detailed musicological analysis, the author's experience as a jazz trumpeter, interpretations of published material by scholars and performers, and, above all, original data from interviews with more than fifty professional musicians: bassists George Duvivier and Rufus Reid; drummers Max Roach, Ronald Shannon Jackson, and Akira Tana; guitarist Emily Remler; pianists Tommy Flanagan and Barry Harris; saxophonists Lou Donaldson, Lee Konitz, and James Moody; trombonist Curtis Fuller; trumpeters Doc Cheatham, Art Farmer, Wynton Marsalis, and Red Rodney; vocalists Carmen Lundy and Vea Williams; and others. Together, the interviews provide insight into the production of jazz by great artists like Betty Carter, Miles Davis, Dizzy Gillespie, Coleman Hawkins, and Charlie Parker.Thinking in Jazz overflows with musical examples from the 1920s to the present, including original transcriptions (keyed to commercial recordings) of collective improvisations by Miles Davis's and John Coltrane's groups. These transcriptions provide additional insight into the structure and creativity of jazz improvisation and represent a remarkable resource for jazz musicians as well as students and educators.Berliner explores the alternative ways{\textemdash}aural, visual, kinetic, verbal, emotional, theoretical, associative{\textemdash}in which these performers conceptualize their music and describes the delicate interplay of soloist and ensemble in collective improvisation. Berliner's skillful integration of data concerning musical development, the rigorous practice and thought artists devote to jazz outside of performance, and the complexities of composing in the moment leads to a new understanding of jazz improvisation as a language, an aesthetic, and a tradition. This unprecedented journey to the heart of the jazz tradition will fascinate and enlighten musicians, musicologists, and jazz fans alike.},

  abstract = {Purpose: We review a series of experiments aimed at studying pitch processing in music and speech. These studies were conducted with musician and non musician adults and children. We found that musical expertise improved pitch processing not only in music but also in speech. Demonstrating transfer of training between music and language has interesting applications for second language teaming. We also addressed the issue of whether the positive effects of musical expertise are linked with specific predispositions for music or with extensive musical practice. Results of longitudinal studies argue for the later. Finally, we also examined pitch processing in dyslexic children and found that they had difficulties discriminating strong pitch changes that are easily discriminate by normal readers. These results argue for a strong link between basic auditory perception abilities and reading abilities.Methods: We used conjointly the behavioral method (Reaction Times and error rates) and the electrophysiological method (recording of the changes in brain electrical activity time-locked to stimulus presentation, Event-Related brain Potentials or ERPs).Results: A set of common processes may be responsible for pitch processing in music and in speech and these processes are shaped by musical practice.Conclusion: These data add evidence in favor of brain plasticity and open interesting perspectives for the remediation of dyslexia using musical training.},

  abstract = {Winner of the 2011 Jolt Excellence Award! Getting software released to users is often a painful, risky, and time-consuming process. This groundbreaking new book sets out the principles and technical practices that enable rapid, incremental delivery of high quality, valuable new functionality to users. Through automation of the build, deployment, and testing process, and improved collaboration between developers, testers, and operations, delivery teams can get changes released in a matter of hours{\textemdash} sometimes even minutes{\textendash}no matter what the size of a project or the complexity of its code base. Jez Humble and David Farley begin by presenting the foundations of a rapid, reliable, low-risk delivery process. Next, they introduce the ``deployment pipeline,'' an automated process for managing all changes, from check-in to release. Finally, they discuss the ``ecosystem'' needed to support continuous delivery, from infrastructure, data and configuration management to governance. The authors introduce state-of-the-art techniques, including automated infrastructure management and data migration, and the use of virtualization. For each, they review key issues, identify best practices, and demonstrate how to mitigate risks. Coverage includes {\textbullet} Automating all facets of building, integrating, testing, and deploying software {\textbullet} Implementing deployment pipelines at team and organizational levels {\textbullet} Improving collaboration between developers, testers, and operations {\textbullet} Developing features incrementally on large and distributed teams {\textbullet} Implementing an effective configuration management strategy {\textbullet} Automating acceptance testing, from analysis to implementation {\textbullet} Testing capacity and other non-functional requirements {\textbullet} Implementing continuous deployment and zero-downtime releases {\textbullet} Managing infrastructure, data, components and dependencies {\textbullet} Navigating risk management, compliance, and auditing Whether you're a developer, systems administrator, tester, or manager, this book will help your organization move from idea to release faster than ever{\textemdash}so you can deliver value to your business rapidly and reliably.},

  abstract = {Musical genres are categorical labels created by humans to characterize pieces of music. A musical genre is characterized by the common characteristics shared by its members. These characteristics typically are related to the instrumentation, rhythmic structure, and harmonic content of the music. Genre hierarchies are commonly used to structure the large collections of music available on the Web. Currently musical genre annotation is performed manually. Automatic musical genre classification can assist or replace the human user in this process and would be a valuable addition to music information retrieval systems. In addition, automatic musical genre classification provides a framework for developing and evaluating features for any type of content-based analysis of musical signals. In this paper, the automatic classification of audio signals into an hierarchy of musical genres is explored. More specifically, three feature sets for representing timbral texture, rhythmic content and pitch content are proposed. The performance and relative importance of the proposed features is investigated by training statistical pattern recognition classifiers using real-world audio collections. Both whole file and real-time frame-based classification schemes are described. Using the proposed feature sets, classification of 61\% for ten musical genres is achieved. This result is comparable to results reported for human musical genre classification.},

  abstract = {Typically, development of robot behavior entails writing the code, deploying it on a simulator or robot and running it for testing. If this feedback reveals errors, the programmer mentally needs to map the error in behavior back to the source code that caused it before being able to fix it. This process suffers from a large cognitive distance between the code and the resulting behavior, which slows down development and can make experimentation with different behaviors prohibitively expensive. In contrast, Live Programming tightens the feedback loop, minimizing cognitive distance. As a result, programmers benefit from an immediate connection with the program that they are making thanks to an immediate, `live' feedback on program behavior. This allows for extremely rapid creation, or variation, of robot behavior and for dramatically increased debugging speed. To enable such Live Robot Programming, in this article we propose a language that provides for live programming of nested state machines and integrates in the Robot Operating System (ROS). We detail the language, named LRP, illustrate how it can be used to rapidly implement a behavior on a running robot and discuss the key points of the language that enables its liveness.},

Studies in Ethnomethodology has inspired a wide range of important theoretical and empirical work in the social sciences and linguistics. It is one of the most original and controversial works in modern social science and it remains at the centre of debate about the current trends and tasks of sociology and social theory. 

Ethnomethodology - the study of the ways in which ordinary people construct a stable social world through everyday utterances and actions - is now a major component of all sociology and linguistics courses. Garfinkel's formidable reputation as one of the worlds leading sociologists rest largely on the work contained in this book.

Studies in Ethnomethodology was originally published by Prentice Hall in 1967 and has remained in print ever since. It is widely used as a text book in this country and in the United States. This new paperback is a special student edition of Garfinkel's modern classic.},

It is argued that longstanding methods of conceptualizing music are vulnerable to Deleuze's critique. But, as Deleuze himself stresses, more important than merely critiquing established paradigms is developing ways to overcome them, and by using Deleuze's own concepts this collection aims to explore that possibility.},

The model tracks the periodicities of different signal property changes that manifest within different frequency bands by using the most appropriate onset/transient detectors for each frequency band. In addition, the proposed system applies a novel method to weight tempo candidates. Each contribution is evaluated by comparing the presented system against existing approaches using three different databases that comprises 1638 songs. These databases include the two publicly available database of songs used in the tempo evaluation contest of ISMIR 2004. These songs are used in order to compare the proposed approach against four recent existing approaches and also against the participants of the tempo detection contest of ISMIR 2004. The results show that the presented approach provides an improvement over existing techniques.},

This paper proposes a novel software visualisation model for supporting object-oriented software comprehension that is intended to address the shortcomings of existing tools. We discuss the previous work that prompted us to develop this model. An initial model is then presented, based on multiple levels of abstraction, multiple perspectives of the software system, and the integration of statically and dynamically extracted information. We review the evaluation tasks used in our previous work and those from the software visualisation and comprehension literature to produce a refined set of evaluation tasks. We then use these tasks to perform an initial assessment of the proposed model. The refined model is then defined more formally. Finally, a concrete example of the use of the model to generate abstraction hierarchies is discussed. We conclude that a visualisation model incorporating a hierarchy of interrelated abstraction levels, combined with structural and behavioural perspectives of the software, will provide effective support for software comprehension.

  title = {Enabling {In}-situ {Execution} of {Coupled} {Scientific} {Workflow} on {Multi}-core {Platform}},
  doi = {10.1109/IPDPS.2012.122},
  abstract = {Emerging scientific application workflows are composed of heterogeneous coupled component applications that simulate different aspects of the physical phenomena being modeled, and that interact and exchange significant volumes of data at runtime. With the increasing performance gap between on-chip data sharing and off-chip data transfers in current systems based on multicore processors, moving large volumes of data using communication network fabric can significantly impact performance. As a result, minimizing the amount of inter-application data exchanges that are across compute nodes and use the network is critical to achieving overall application performance and system efficiency. In this paper, we investigate the in-situ execution of the coupled components of a scientific application workflow so as to maximize on-chip exchange of data. Specifically, we present a distributed data sharing and task execution framework that (1) employs data-centric task placement to map computations from the coupled applications onto processor cores so that a large portion of the data exchanges can be performed using the intra-node shared memory, (2) provides a shared space programming abstraction that supplements existing parallel programming models (e.g., message passing) with specialized one-sided asynchronous data access operators and can be used to express coordination and data exchanges between the coupled components. We also present the implementation of the framework and its experimental evaluation on the Jaguar Cray XT5 at Oak Ridge National Laboratory.},

  abstract = {This field-defining collection consolidates and builds momentum in the burgeoning area of affect studies. The contributors include many of the central theorists of affect{\textemdash}those visceral forces beneath, alongside, or generally other than conscious knowing that can serve to drive us toward movement, thought, and ever-changing forms of relation. As Lauren Berlant explores ``cruel optimism,'' Brian Massumi theorizes the affective logic of public threat, and Elspeth Probyn examines shame, they, along with the other contributors, show how an awareness of affect is opening up exciting new insights in disciplines from anthropology, cultural studies, geography, and psychology to philosophy, queer studies, and sociology. In essays diverse in subject matter, style, and perspective, the contributors demonstrate how affect theory illuminates the intertwined realms of the aesthetic, the ethical, and the political as they play out across bodies (human and non-human) in both mundane and extraordinary ways. They reveal the broad theoretical possibilities opened by an awareness of affect as they reflect on topics including ethics, food, public morale, glamor, snark in the workplace, and mental health regimes. The Affect Theory Reader includes an interview with the cultural theorist Lawrence Grossberg and an afterword by the anthropologist Kathleen Stewart. In the introduction, the editors suggest ways of defining affect, trace the concept's history, and highlight the role of affect theory in various areas of study.ContributorsSara Ahmed

  abstract = {This research investigates the use of emotion data derived from analyzing change in activity in the autonomic nervous system (ANS) as revealed by brainwave production to support the creative music compositional intelligence of an adaptive interface. A relational model of the influence of musical events on the listener's affect is first induced using inductive logic programming paradigms with the emotion data and musical score features as inputs of the induction task. The components of composition such as interval and scale, instrumentation, chord progression and melody are automatically combined using genetic algorithm and melodic transformation heuristics that depend on the predictive knowledge and character of the induced model. Out of the four targeted basic emotional states, namely, stress, joy, sadness, and relaxation, the empirical results reported here show that the system is able to successfully compose tunes that convey one of these affective states.

The rules are simple: make things visible, exploit natural relationships that couple function and control, and make intelligent use of constraints.

  abstract = {Gilles Deleuze, a major figure in the intellectual history of the late-20th century, inaugurated the radical non-Hegelianism that has marked French intellectual life during the past three decades. Many poststructuralist and postmodernist practices can be traced to Deleuze's 1962 resurrection of Nietzsche against Hegel. Hardt shows how Deleuze's early analysis of Bergson's critique of ontology and determination led him to a conception of a positive movement of differentiation and becoming, which in turn led him to the field of forces, sense, value, and the thematic of power and affirmation in Nietzsche. The theory of power in Nietzsche provided the link for Deleuze to an ethics of active expression in Spinoza: Deleuze's discovery and analysis of Spinoza's cultivation of joy and practice at the center of ontology finally resulted in a complete break from the Hegelian paradigm that had reigned over continental philosophy and history. Michael Hardt is the translator of Antonio Negri's "The Savage Anomaly: the Power of Spinoza's Metaphysics and Politics" (Minnesota, 1990), Giorgio Agamben's "The Coming Community" (Minnesota, 1993), and co-author (with Antonio Negri) of "Labor of Dionysus" (Minnesota).},

This leads to the introduction of Tidal 0.4, a Domain Specific Language embedded in Haskell. This is a substantial restructuring of Tidal, which now represents musical pattern as functions from time to events, inspired by Functional Reactive Programming.},

The technologies incorporated in these simulations, including graphic modeling, haptic (tactile and kinesthetic) interface design, and haptic cognitive studies, reconstruct surgical knowledge that traditionally remains tacit, such as knowledge of surgeons' movements and forces used on tissues. A surgeon's physical experience becomes mathematized when programmers reconstruct it for computers. This paper describes how researchers construct 'body objects', representations of bodies and body parts that are engineered to inhabit computer programs. This paper argues that surgical learning occurs at the interface of bodies and instruments, through simultaneous sculpting of the surgical site and training of the surgeon's body, a process I call mutual articulation.},

  abstract = {Sensitivity analysis (SA) is a fundamental tool of uncertainty quantification(UQ). Adjoint-based SA is the optimal approach in many large-scale applications, such as the direct numerical simulation (DNS) of combustion. However, one of the challenges of the adjoint workflow for time-dependent applications is the storage and I/O requirements for the application state. During the time-reversal portion of the workflow, forward state is required in last-in-first-out order. The resulting requirements for storage at exascale are enormous. To mitigate this requirement, application state is regenerated from checkpoints over short windows of application time. This approach drastically reduces the total volume of stored data, allows the caching of state in the regeneration window in memory and on local SSDs, may accelerate the application execution by reducing output frequency, and reduces the power overhead from I/O. We explore variations to this workflow, applied to a proxy for the SA of turbulent combustion, by varying checkpoint number, state storage, and other regeneration options to find efficient implementations for minimizing compute time or power consumption.},

  abstract = {Scientific workflow systems support various workflow representations, operational modes, and configurations. Regardless of the system used, end users have common needs: to track the status of their workflows in real time, be notified of execution anomalies and failures automatically, perform troubleshooting, and automate the analysis of the workflow results. In this paper, we describe how the Stampede monitoring infrastructure was integrated with the Pegasus Workflow Management System and the Triana Workflow Systems, in order to add generic real time monitoring and troubleshooting capabilities across both systems. Stampede is an infrastructure that provides interoperable monitoring using a three-layer model: (1) a common data model to describe workflow and job executions; (2) high-performance tools to load workflow logs conforming to the data model into a data store; and (3) a common query interface. This paper describes the integration of Stampede monitoring architecture with Pegasus and Triana and shows the new analysis capabilities that Stampede provides to these workflow systems. The successful integration of Stampede with these workflow engines demonstrates the generic nature of the Stampede monitoring infrastructure and its potential to provide a common platform for monitoring across scientific workflow engines.},

  abstract = {Drawing on published and unpublished sources, this article traces the changing ways in which Schoenberg made his sketches, fragments, and the creative process in general integral aspects of both his identity as a composer and the reception of his music. One side of this story is Schoenberg's well-known concern for how posterity would view him, evident in his obsession with demonstrating his stature as a genius and defining his place in history as the first to break with tonality and as the inventor of "the method of composing with twelve tones related only to one another." But as significant for the present context are the ways that, beginning in the first decade of the century, he started to make his Nachla{\ss} known through the dissemination of manuscripts, sketches, and fragments, and by means of discussions of the creative process and compositional techniques in his voluminous writings. Schoenberg's interjection of the act of composition into public musical discourse has clear origins in the nineteenth century, but it also has important implications for the blurring of boundaries between the work, the creative process, the artist, and the audience, a characteristic of twentieth- and twenty-first-century art and now a fundamental feature of our cultural life.},

  volume = {6},
  url = {http://www.jstor.org/stable/1572419},
  abstract = {The advent of computing stimulates a desire to re-examine the subject of creativity. Though the computer can replace man in the production of graphic images, its function in the arts is seen as assisting in the specification of art systems and in their subsequent real-time management. An art of system or process is placed in the context of primarily the visual or plastic arts but the authors disavow concern with any 'new' or 'modern technological' art. Various types of art systems are mentioned and advantages of the fully interactive one are considered. It is pointed out that the inclusion of complex real-time responses in an interactive art system can frequently make use of a computer. In such work, the artist and the viewer play an integral part. The traditional role of the artist, composer or writer is thus called into question; it may no longer be necessary to assume that he is a specialist in art--rather he is a catalyst of creative activity. Three cases are discussed to illustrate the applications of this approach. /// L'av\`{e}nement de l'informatique exige que l'on reconsid\`{e}re le probl\`{e}me de la cr\'{e}ativit\'{e}. Bien que l'ordinateur puisse remplacer l'homme dans la production d'images graphiques, on peut penser que sa fonction dans les arts est d'aider \`{a} sp\'{e}cifier les syst\`{e}mes artistiques, et \`{a} les r\'{e}partir ult\'{e}rieurement dans le temps r\'{e}el. Un art du syst\`{e}me et du processus se situe d'abord dans le contexte des arts visuels ou plastiques; cependant la pr\'{e}occupation des auteurs n'est d'aucune mani\`{e}re un art 'nouveau' ou 'technologique'. Ils citent plusieurs sortes de syst\`{e}mes artistiques et d\'{e}crivent les avantages de celui qui est enti\`{e}rement 'interactif'. Ils font remarquer que l'inclusion de r\'{e}ponses complexes du temps r\'{e}el dans un syst\`{e}me artistique interactif peut souvent appeler l'utilisation d'un ordinateur. Dans une telle {\oe}uvre, l'artiste et le spectateur jouent un r\^{o}le \`{a} part enti\`{e}re. Le r\^{o}le traditionnel de l'artiste, du compositeur ou de l'\'{e}crivain est ainsi remis en question; il n'est plus n\'{e}cessaire d'affirmer que l'artiste est un sp\'{e}cialiste--il est plut\^{o}t le catalyseur d'une activit\'{e} cr\'{e}atrice. Trois exemples illustrent les applications de cette approche.},

Four violin players were asked to play, alone or in duo, a music fragment in two different perceptual feedback modalities and in four different emotional states. We focused our attention on phase synchronisation of the head motions of the players. From observation by subjects (musicians and observers), an evidence of entrainment emerges between players. The preliminary results, based on a reduced data set, however do not grasp fully this phenomenon. A more extended analysis is current subject of investigation.},

  abstract = {Contemporary musical instrument design using computers provides nearly limitless potential for designing the mapping between gesture and sound. When designing effective and expressive musical instruments, the types of relationship between musician/player and his instrument and the aesthetics of the relationships must be considered. This paper discusses four types of relationships and their aesthetics. A high degree of intimacy is achieved when the relationship reaches a level where the mapping between control and sound is transparent to the player, that is, the player embodies the device. Ultimately, this type of relationship allows intent and expression to flow through the player to the sound and, hence, create music. Three new interfaces for musical expression, the Iamascope, Sound Sculpting and Tooka, provide examples of how instruments may be designed to develop and explore intimacy and embodiment of new musical instruments.},

A univariate time series can be represented by a fixed-length vector whose components are statistical features of the time series, capturing the global structure. These descriptive vectors, one for each component of the multivariate time series, are concatenated, before being clustered using a standard fast clustering algorithm such as k-means or hierarchical clustering. Such statistical feature extraction also serves as a dimension-reduction procedure for multivariate time series. We demonstrate the effectiveness and simplicity of our proposed method by clustering human motion sequences: dynamic and high-dimensional multivariate time series. The proposed method based on univariate time series structure and statistical metrics provides a novel, yet simple and flexible way to cluster multivariate time series data efficiently with promising accuracy. The success of our method on the case study suggests that clustering may be a valuable addition to the tools available for human motion pattern recognition research.},

The IDE is geared towards touch based devices without keyboards, ranging from phones, over tablets, to large display screens. Programs can be edited and run on the device without an auxiliary PC. Transitioning between programming on one device, and continuing on another device is seamless. The web application also works offline. TouchDevelop has been successfully applied to teaching introductory programming classes at the high-school level and at some college level for non-CS majors. For researchers, TouchDevelop provides a green-field platform to explore IDE and programming language design, as well as runtime techniques and distributed data storage abstractions. In this talk, I will provide an overview of TouchDevelop from a language, IDE, and runtime perspective, while diving into some of the novel techniques enabled by our particular platform.},

  abstract = {Many scientific disciplines are now data and information driven, and new scientific knowledge is often gained by scientists putting together data analysis and knowledge discovery `pipelines'. A related trend is that more and more scientific communities realize the benefits of sharing their data and computational services, and are thus contributing to a distributed data and computational community infrastructure (a.k.a. `the Grid'). However, this infrastructure is only a means to an end and ideally scientists should not be too concerned with its existence. The goal is for scientists to focus on development and use of what we call scientific workflows. These are networks of analytical steps that may involve, e.g., database access and querying steps, data analysis and mining steps, and many other steps including computationally intensive jobs on high-performance cluster computers. In this paper we describe characteristics of and requirements for scientific workflows as identified in a number of our application projects. We then elaborate on Kepler, a particular scientific workflow system, currently under development across a number of scientific data management projects. We describe some key features of Kepler and its underlying Ptolemy II system, planned extensions, and areas of future research. Kepler is a community-driven, open source project, and we always welcome related projects and new contributors to join. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2005 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Visualization and team sports have an important and established relationship that is seldom understood. Team sports can be considered as complex activities containing a considerable number of abstract datasets and participant categories, such as athletes, coaches, referees and spectators. This paper proposes that the field of visualization has been applied within team sports in various ways to provide these participants with representations of these datasets. This has resulted in data-augmented games which are easier to play, judge and watch respectively. This paper provides a review of past and current applications of visualization within team sports. A model is presented to classify sports visualizations along conceptual axes. This model allows future or potentially untapped applications of team sports visualization to be identified and classified View full abstract},

In addition, for each sub-field a small number of open research (or research strategy) issues are identified that should be addressed in order to further advance the SMC field.},

We first argue that musical expression with multi-person instruments is a form of communication between the players. We illustrate that design for musical collaboration facilitates exploration of sound space with low entry-level skill. In contrast to the western post-Renaissance focus on musical expression through virtuosity, collaborative musical experiences enable the media of sound and music to enhance the communication opportunities and intimacy between players. The main factor common to most of the interfaces discussed herein is that musical control is highly restricted, which makes it possible for novices to easily learn and participate in the collective experience. This happens at the expense of providing an upward path to virtuosity with the interface. Balancing this tradeoff is a key concern for designers. We look closely at many contemporary collaborative interface designs, with each exploring a different way to achieve successful musical experiences for novice players.},

By paying close attention to the metaphors of AI and their consequences for the field's patterns of success and failure, it argues for a reorientation of the field away from thought and toward activity. By considering computational ideas in a large, philosophical framework, the author eases critical dialogue between technology and the social sciences. AI can benefit from an understanding of the field in relation to human nature, and in return, it offers a powerful mode of investigation into the practicalities of physical realization. Researchers in AI and cognitive science will welcome this timely discussion.},

  abstract = {Intended for designers and researchers, Context and Consciousness brings together 13 contributions that apply activity theory to problems of human-computer interaction.Understanding how people actually use computers in their everyday lives is essential to good design and evaluation. This insight necessitates a move out of the laboratory and into the field. The research described in Context and Consciousness presents activity theory as a means of structuring and guiding field studies of human-computer interaction, from practical design to theoretical development. Activity theory is a psychological theory with a naturalistic emphasis, with roots going back to the 1920s in the Soviet Union. It provides a hierarchical framework for describing activity and a set of perspectives on practice. Activity theory has been fruitfully applied in many areas of human need, including problems of mentally and physically handicapped children, educational testing, curriculum design, and ergonomics. There is growing interest in applying activity theory to problems of human- computer interaction, and an international community of researchers is contributing to the effort.Contributors : Rachel Bellamy.

  abstract = {Meeting the Universe Halfway is an ambitious book with far-reaching implications for numerous fields in the natural sciences, social sciences, and humanities. In this volume, Karen Barad, theoretical physicist and feminist theorist, elaborates her theory of agential realism. Offering an account of the world as a whole rather than as composed of separate natural and social realms, agential realism is at once a new epistemology, ontology, and ethics. The starting point for Barad's analysis is the philosophical framework of quantum physicist Niels Bohr. Barad extends and partially revises Bohr's philosophical views in light of current scholarship in physics, science studies, and the philosophy of science as well as feminist, poststructuralist, and other critical social theories. In the process, she significantly reworks understandings of space, time, matter, causality, agency, subjectivity, and objectivity.In an agential realist account, the world is made of entanglements of ``social'' and ``natural'' agencies, where the distinction between the two emerges out of specific intra-actions. Intra-activity is an inexhaustible dynamism that configures and reconfigures relations of space-time-matter. In explaining intra-activity, Barad reveals questions about how nature and culture interact and change over time to be fundamentally misguided. And she reframes understanding of the nature of scientific and political practices and their ``interrelationship.'' Thus she pays particular attention to the responsible practice of science, and she emphasizes changes in the understanding of political practices, critically reworking Judith Butler's influential theory of performativity. Finally, Barad uses agential realism to produce a new interpretation of quantum physics, demonstrating that agential realism is more than a means of reflecting on science; it can be used to actually do science.},

  abstract = {Software evolution is characterized by its changing in accord with environment and requirement. It is one of the most difficult and important problems of software. From the runtime perspective, it includes two types: static evolution and dynamic evolution. Static evolution is mainly implemented by human static intervention and analysis. Dynamic evolution is based on the runtime evolution of software, mainly characterized as software self-adapting to environment. This paper presents a change-tracing model that regards the change as the starting point and focuses on software evolution in OO paradigm. It illustrates the change transmission and implementation process during the whole software lifecycle. Concerning the similarity between the change transmission process and the software lifecycle, a research framework of software evolution is proposed. This framework integrates all elements that are involved in the change transmission process, such as scenario, object, component and SA (Software Architecture). Based on this framework, the research of software evolution will be more effective and ties in dynamic evolution. At the end of paper, it gives some detailed discussion of key problems of software evolution in the framework and the corresponding solvability ideas. View full abstract},

Studying the 3D collagen network in AC offers a way to determine the condition of the cartilage. However, traditional qualitative studies are time consuming and subjective. This study aims to develop a computer vision-based classifier to automatically determine the condition of AC tissue based on the structural characteristics of the collagen network. Texture analysis was applied to quantitatively characterise the 3D collagen structure in normal (International Cartilage Repair Society, ICRS, grade 0), aged (ICRS grade 1) and osteoarthritic cartilages (ICRS grade 2). Principle component techniques and linear discriminant analysis were then used to classify the microstructural characteristics of the 3D collagen meshwork and the condition of the AC. The 3D collagen meshwork in the three physiological condition groups displayed distinctive characteristics. Texture analysis indicated a...},

Pliability refers to the sense of malleability and tightly coupled interaction that makes the use of an interactive visualization captivating. Rhythm is an important characteristic of certain types of interaction, from the sub-second pacing of musical interaction to the hour-scale ebb and flow of peripheral emotional communication. Dramaturgical structure is not only a feature of online role-playing games, but plays an important role in several design genres from the most mundane to the more intellectually sophisticated.

The work involves the development of a software library for the purpose of encapsulating compositional ideas in software, and realising these ideas in performance through a live coding computer music practice. The thesis examines what artistic practice emerges through live coding and software development, and does this permit a blurring between the activities of music composition and performance. The role that software design plays in affecting musical outcomes is considered to gain an insight into how software development contributes to artistic development. The relationship between music composition and performance is also examined to identify the means by which engaging in live coding and software development can bring these activities together. The thesis, situated within the discourse of practice led research, documents a journey which uses the experience of software development and performance as a means to guide the direction of the research. The journey serves as an experiment for the author in engaging an hitherto unfamiliar musical practice, and as a roadmap for others seeking to modify or broaden their artistic practice.},

This article surveys the early and current efforts in this topic and proposes a taxonomy to identify the main concepts related to addressing issues in dynamic steering of high performance computing (HPC) in scientific workflows. The main concepts are related to putting the human-in-the-loop of the workflow lifecycle, involving user support in real-time monitoring, notification, analysis and interference by adapting the workflow execution at runtime.},

  abstract = {Complex-systems describe multiple levels of collective structure and organization. In such systems, the emergence of global behaviour from local interactions is generally studied through large scale experiments on numerical models. This analysis generates important computation loads which require the use of multi-core servers, clusters or grid computing. Dealing with such large scale executions is especially challenging for modellers who do not possess the theoretical and methodological skills required to take advantage of high performance computing environments. That is why we have designed a cloud approach for model experimentation. This approach has been implemented in OpenMOLE (Open MOdeL Experiment) as a Domain Specific Language (DSL) that leverages the naturally parallel aspect of model experiments. The OpenMOLE DSL has been designed to explore user-supplied models. It delegates transparently their numerous executions to remote execution environment. From a user perspective, those environments are viewed as services providing computing power, therefore no technical detail is ever exposed. This paper presents the OpenMOLE DSL through the example of a toy model exploration and through the automated calibration of a real-world complex-system model in the field of geography.},

I begin by surveying definitions of copyright and patent law, and related issues, to situate live coding in the field of existing perspectives on cultural ownership. Drawing on legal theory and critical discourse on improvised music in other genres, I then argue that the dynamic, palimpsestic, and improvisational qualities of live coding contradict many of copyright law's core assumptions regarding the nature of ``fixed'' works of art. These contradictions can be usefully mobilized for the purpose of resisting legal and economic enclosures of the digital cultural commons. As I conclude, live coding can, from its current, inherently ambivalent position on copyright matters, develop a strong, performance-based cr...},

Makers is about how all that is being reversed. Over the past ten years, the internet has democratised publishing, broadcasting and communications, leading to a massive increase in the range of participation in everything digital - the world of bits. Now the same is happening to manufacturing - the world of things. Chris Anderson, bestselling author of The Long Tail, explains how this is happening: how such technologies as 3D printing and electronics assembly are becoming available to everybody, and how people are building successful businesses as a result. Whereas once every aspiring entrepreneur needed the support of a major manufacturer, now anybody with a smart idea and a little expertise can make their ideas a reality. Just as Google, Facebook and others have created highly successful companies in the virtual world, so these new inventors and manufacturers are assuming positions of ever greater importance in the real world.

  abstract = {This paper describes a pattern of explanation prevalent in the biological sciences that I call a `lineage explanation'. The aim of these explanations is to make plausible certain trajectories of change through phenotypic space. They do this by laying out a series of stages, where each stage shows how some mechanism worked, and the differences between each adjacent stage demonstrates how one mechanism, through minor modifications, could be changed into another. These explanations are important, for though it is widely accepted that there is an `incremental constraint' on evolutionary change, in an important class of cases it is difficult to see how to satisfy this constraint. I show that lineage explanations answer important questions about evolutionary change, but do so by demonstrating differences between individuals rather than invoking population processes, such as natural selection.IntroductionTurning a `Scale' into a `Plume'Lineage Explanations in BiologyThe evolution of eyesThe evolution of feathersThe Two Dimensions of a Lineage ExplanationThe production dimensionThe continuity dimensionThe dual role of the partsConstraining the ExplanationsOperational and Generative LineagesExplaining Change Without PopulationsConclusion},

Even "end-user" programmers in previous studies have often worked in organizations where programming is recognized to be demanding professional work-the term "power-user" recognizes this technical kudos. But as personal computers become widespread, and most new domestic appliances incorporate microprocessors, many people are engaging in programming-like activities in domestic or nonprofessional contexts. Such users often have less motivation and more obstacles to programming, meaning that they may be unlikely even to take the first steps. This paper analyses the generic nature of those first steps, and identifies the cognitive demands that characterize them. On the basis of this analysis the paper proposes the attention investment model, a cognitive model of programming that offers a consistent account of all programming behaviour, from professionals to end-users.

  abstract = {We propose in this work a new family of kernels for variable-length time series. Our work builds upon the vector autoregressive (VAR) model for multivariate stochastic processes: given a multivariate time series x, we consider the likelihood function p\_\{{\textbackslash}theta\}(x) of different parameters {\textbackslash}theta in the VAR model as features to describe x. To compare two time series x and x', we form the product of their features p\_\{{\textbackslash}theta\}(x) p\_\{{\textbackslash}theta\}(x') which is integrated out w.r.t {\textbackslash}theta using a matrix normal-inverse Wishart prior. Among other properties, this kernel can be easily computed when the dimension d of the time series is much larger than the lengths of the considered time series x and x'. It can also be generalized to time series taking values in arbitrary state spaces, as long as the state space itself is endowed with a kernel {\textbackslash}kappa. In that case, the kernel between x and x' is a a function of the Gram matrices produced by {\textbackslash}kappa on observations and subsequences of observations enumerated in x and x'. We describe a computationally efficient implementation of this generalization that uses low-rank matrix factorization techniques. These kernels are compared to other known kernels using a set of benchmark classification tasks carried out with support vector machines.},

  abstract = {Most languages expose the computer's ability to globally read and write memory at any time. Programmers must then choreograph control flow so all reads and writes occur in correct relative orders, which can be difficult particularly when dealing with initialization, reactivity, and concurrency. Just as many languages now manage memory to unburden us from properly freeing memory, they should also manage time to automatically order memory accesses for us in the interests of comprehensibility, correctness, and simplicity. Time management is a general language feature with a large design space that is largely unexplored; we offer this perspective to relate prior work and guide future research. We introduce Glitch as a form of managed time that replays code for an appearance of simultaneous memory updates, avoiding the need for manual order. The key to such replay reaching consistent program states is an ability to reorder and rollback updates as needed, restricting the imperative model while retaining the basic concepts of memory access and control flow. This approach can also handle code to enable live programming that incrementally revises program executions in an IDE under arbitrary code changes.},

Ingrid Monson juxtaposes musicians' talk and musical examples to ask how musicians go about "saying something" through music in a way that articulates identity, politics, and race. Through interviews with Jaki Byard, Richard Davis, Sir Roland Hanna, Billy Higgins, Cecil McBee, and others, she develops a perspective on jazz improvisation that has "interactiveness" at its core, in the creation of music through improvisational interaction, in the shaping of social communities and networks through music, and in the development of cultural meanings and ideologies that inform the interpretation of jazz in twentieth-century American cultural life. Replete with original musical transcriptions, this broad view of jazz improvisation and its emotional and cultural power will have a wide audience among jazz fans, ethnomusicologists, and anthropologists.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Electroencephalography (EEG) is an important tool for studying the temporal dynamics of the human brain's large-scale neuronal circuits. However, most EEG applications fail to capitalize on all of the data's available information, particularly that concerning the location of active sources in the brain. Localizing the sources of a given scalp measurement is only achieved by solving the so-called inverse problem. By introducing reasonable a priori constraints, the inverse problem can be solved and the most probable sources in the brain at every moment in time can be accurately localized. METHODS AND RESULTS: Here, we review the different EEG source localization procedures applied during the last two decades. Additionally, we detail the importance of those procedures preceding and following source estimation that are intimately linked to a successful, reliable result. We discuss (1) the number and positioning of electrodes, (2) the varieties of inverse solution models and algorithms, (3) the integration of EEG source estimations with MRI data, (4) the integration of time and frequency in source imaging, and (5) the statistical analysis of inverse solution results. CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE: We show that modern EEG source imaging simultaneously details the temporal and spatial dimensions of brain activity, making it an important and affordable tool to study the properties of cerebral, neural networks in cognitive and clinical neurosciences.},

  abstract = {We present Theseus, an IDE extension that visualizes run-time behavior within a JavaScript code editor. By displaying real-time information about how code actually behaves during execution, Theseus proactively addresses misconceptions by drawing attention to similarities and differences between the programmer's idea of what code does and what it actually does. To understand how programmers would respond to this kind of an always-on visualization, we ran a lab study with graduate students, and interviewed 9 professional programmers who were asked to use Theseus in their day-to-day work. We found that users quickly adopted strategies that are unique to always-on, real-time visualizations, and used the additional information to guide their navigation through their code.},

  abstract = {Video surveillance is an omnipresent topic when it comes to enhancing security and safety in the intelligent home environments. In this paper, we propose a novel method to detect various posture-based events in a typical elderly monitoring application in a home surveillance scenario. These events include normal daily life activities, abnormal behaviors and unusual events. Due to the fact that falling and its physical-psychological consequences in the elderly are a major health hazard, we monitor human activities with a particular interest to the problem of fall detection. Combination of best-fit approximated ellipse around the human body, projection histograms of the segmented silhouette and temporal changes of head position, would provide a useful cue for detection of different behaviors. Extracted feature vectors are fed to a MLP neural network for precise classification of motions and determination of fall event. Reliable recognition rate of experimental results underlines satisfactory performance of our system.},

The application was developed to process astronomy data released by the Kepler project, a NASA mission to search for Earth-like planets orbiting other stars. This workflow was deployed across multiple clouds using the Pegasus Workflow Management System. The clouds used include several sites within the FutureGrid, NERSC's Magellan cloud, and Amazon EC2. We describe how the application was deployed, evaluate its performance executing in different clouds (based on Nimbus, Eucalyptus, and EC2), and discuss the challenges of deploying and executing workflows in a cloud environment. We also demonstrate how Pegasus was able to support sky computing by executing a single workflow across multiple cloud infrastructures simultaneously.},

  doi = {10.1109/TSA.2005.858542},
  abstract = {This paper presents a new extension to the variable duration hidden Markov model (HMM), capable of, classifying musical pattens that have been extracted from raw audio data into a set of predefined classes. Each musical pattern is converted into a sequence of music intervals by means of a fundamental frequency tracking procedure. This sequence is subsequently presented as input to a set of variable-duration HMMs. Each one of these models has been trained to recognize patterns of a corresponding predefined class. Classification is determined based on the highest recognition probability. The new type of variable-duration hidden Markov modeling proposed in this paper results in enhanced performance because 1) it deals effectively with errors that commonly originate during the feature extraction stage, and 2) it accounts for variations due to the individual expressive performance of different instrument players. To demonstrate its effectiveness, the novel classification scheme has been employed in the context of Greek traditional music, to monophonic musical patterns of a popular instrument,the Greek traditional clarinet. Although the method is also appropriate for western-style music, Greek traditional music poses extra difficulties and makes music pattern recognition a harder task. The classification results demonstrate that the new approach outperforms previous work based on conventional HMMs.},

  abstract = {As the growing in Internet, database types and sizes are getting various and larger. The topic of finding out the significant information from a database at the shortest time is important. In the music databases, a repeating pattern is an important feature of music objects, which commonly used in analyzing the repeated part of music data and looking for themes. Most of the repeating patterns are key melodies or easy to familiarize and remember for people. Therefore, we can use the themes or the repeating patterns to construct indices that can speedup query execution for music retrievals. Nevertheless, non-trivial repeating patterns exclude those patterns, which are all contained in other longer patterns, such that they can reduce the redundancy of the repeating patterns and save the index space needed. Most of existing algorithms are time consuming for finding non-trivial repeating patterns in a music object. In this research, we aim to apply the true suffix tree approach to discover non-trivial repeating patterns for a music object, which can efficiently address the cost problems in processing time and memory space. In general case, our proposed scheme can extract non-trivial repeating patterns in a linear time.},

In our Max/FTS-based experimental environment, a virtual object functions as input device for the editing of sound - the sound artist literally "sculpts" sounds by changing virtual object attributes (shape, position and orientation). We identified three sculpting methods and discuss one for use in physical and abstract mapping strategies. In pilot mapping experiments, the main problems we encountered were the search for interaction metaphors that can quickly be understood, incorporation of manipulation pragmatics in mappings, "touching" the virtual object and real-time computability.},

  abstract = {Although the body has been the focus of much contemporary cultural theory, the models that are typically applied neglect the most salient characteristics of embodied existence{\textemdash}movement, affect, and sensation{\textemdash}in favor of concepts derived from linguistic theory. In Parables for the Virtual Brian Massumi views the body and media such as television, film, and the Internet, as cultural formations that operate on multiple registers of sensation beyond the reach of the reading techniques founded on the standard rhetorical and semiotic models.
Renewing and assessing William James's radical empiricism and Henri
Bergson's philosophy of perception through the filter of the post-war French philosophy of Deleuze, Guattari, and Foucault, Massumi links a cultural logic of variation to questions of movement, affect, and sensation. If such concepts are as fundamental as signs and significations, he argues, then a new set of theoretical issues appear, and with them potential new paths for the wedding of scientific and cultural theory. Replacing the traditional opposition of literal and figural with new distinctions between stasis and motion and between actual and virtual, Parables for the Virtual tackles related theoretical issues by applying them to cultural mediums as diverse as architecture, body art, the digital art of Stelarc, and Ronald Reagan's acting career. The result is an intriguing combination of cultural theory, science, and philosophy that asserts itself in a crystalline and multi-faceted argument.
Parables for the Virtual will interest students and scholars of continental and Anglo-American philosophy, cultural studies, cognitive science, electronic art, digital culture, and chaos theory, as well as those concerned with the ``science wars'' and the relation between the humanities and the sciences in general.},

  abstract = {Psychoacoustics - Facts and Models represents a comprehensive collection of data describing the processing of sound by the human hearing system. It includes quantitative relations between sound stimuli and auditory perception in terms of hearing sensations. In addition, quantitative psychoacoustic models of hearing sensations are given. The monograph contains a unique collection of data on the human hearing system as a receiver of acoustic information as well as many examples of the practical application of the results of basic research in fields such as audiology, noise evaluation, and sound engineering. Many helpful hints for the solution of practical problems will be of particular benefit to engineers, and the book as a whole should serve as an important benchmark in the field of psychoacoustics. The treatment given in this second edition has been thoroughly updated with recent results.},

  abstract = {Group Creativity explores the unique form of creativity that emerges from collaborating groups. Dr. Sawyer draws on his studies of jazz ensembles and improvisational theater groups to develop a model of creative group processes. He applies this model of group creativity to a wide range of collaborating groups, including group learning in classrooms and innovative teams in organizations. 

In group creativity, a group comes together to collaboratively create in real time. The creative inspiration emerges from the interaction and communication among the members, and makes the result more than the sum of its parts. The dynamic, moment-to-moment communication among jazz musicians and improvising actors is the primary topic of the book. Sawyer explores performers' close listening and sensitivity, the submerging of the ego to the group mind, and the ways that performers work together to create something better than and different from what one solitary individual could create alone. These explorations provide insight into all forms of group creativity and collaboration.},

  abstract = {There has been large amount of hydrological data collected by various sensors during the last years and how to discover the hidden knowledge among these data has caused more and more attention from diverse fields, such as hydrologist and researchers from data mining. This paper deals with similarity mining from hydrological time series and concentrates itself on the similarity analysis of multivariate time series (MTS). A novel similarity measure has been put forward, which is based on the well-known BORDA count in multiple classifier system. Firstly, dimension reduction is adaptively conducted according to the target data complexity; then the similarity of single time series is computed and lastly, the overall similarity of the MTS is obtained by synthesizing each of the single similarity based on BORDA count. Experiments on the similarity analysis of water level data of TAIHU Lake and historical flood data from YIFENG Basin have shown the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract = {Classifications of visualization are often based on technical criteria, and leave out artistic ways of visualizing information. Understanding the differences between information visualization and other forms of visual communication provides important insights into the way the field works, though, and also shows the path to new approaches. We propose a classification of several types of information visualization based on aesthetic criteria. The notions of artistic and pragmatic visualization are introduced, and their properties discussed. Finally, the idea of visualization criticism is proposed, and its rules are laid out. Visualization criticism bridges the gap between design, art, and technical/pragmatic information visualization. It guides the view away from implementation details and single mouse clicks to the meaning of a visualization.},

Agile methods advocate close customer collaboration in the early phases of software development. However, research on how to maintain agile ways of working during software evolution is scarce. Based on a qualitative interview study, this paper explores how benefits of agile practices can be established and maintained in the evolution phase of software development. We direct our attention to large-scale software development of embedded systems where development companies struggle to meet the needs of a large customer base. The contribution of this paper is two-fold. First, we propose customer-specific teams as a way to reap the benefits of agile methods in the evolution phase of large-scale software development. Second, we confirm the use of these teams as successful for improving customer responsiveness, customer satisfaction and feature quality during software evolution. View full abstract},

  abstract = {The advent of social media is changing the existing information behavior by letting users access to real-time online information channels without the constraints of time and space. It also generates a huge amount of data worth discovering novel knowledge. Social media, therefore, has created an enormous challenge for scientists trying to keep pace with developments in their field. Most of the previous studies have adopted broad-brush approaches which tend to result in providing limited analysis. To handle these problems properly, we introduce our real-time Twitter trend mining system, RT2M, which operates in real-time to process big stream datasets available on Twitter. The system offers the functions of term co-occurrence retrieval, visualization of Twitter users by query, similarity calculation between two users, Topic Modeling to keep track of changes of topical trend, and analysis on mention-based user networks. We also demonstrate an empirical study on 2012 Korean presidential election. The case study reveals Twitter could be a useful source to detect and predict the advent and changes of social issues, and analysis of mention-based user networks could show different aspects of user behaviors.

  abstract = {In this paper we present a new approach to deterministic replay using standard components. Our method facilitates cyclic debugging of real-time systems with industry standard real-time operating systems using industry standard debuggers. The method is based on a number of new techniques: A new marker for deterministic differentiation between e.g., loop iterations for deterministic reproduction of interrupts and task preemptions, an algorithm for finding well-defined starting points of replay sessions, as well as a technique for using conditional breakpoints in standard debuggers to replay the target system. We also propose and discuss different methods for deterministic monitoring, and provide benchmarking results from an industrial strength case study demonstrating the feasibility of our method. Previously published solutions to the problem of debugging real-time systems have been based on the concept of deterministic replay: where significant system events like task-switches of multitasking software and external inputs are recorded during run-time, and later replayed (re-executed) off-line. Previous works have been based on either non-standard hardware, specially designed compilers or modified real-time operating systems. The reliance on non-standard components has limited the success of the approach. Even though this idea has been around for 20 years, no industrial application for debugging of real-time systems of the method has been presented. View full abstract},

It will be an invaluable tool for the novice researcher and a useful text for courses in qualitative research in social science programmes.},

We have proposed an archiving method specifically for dancing patterns. Our method has four main stages: 1) digitizing motions by motion capture systems; 2) analyzing motions; 3) synthesizing motions; and 4) reproducing the dance motions by CG (computer-generated) and humanoid robots. In order to effectively record the movement patterns, motion primitives are extracted. Each motion primitive describes each basic motion. However, most previous primitive extraction failed to provide the rhythm, which results in unrhythmic, synthesized motion. In this paper, we propose a motion analysis method, which integrates music rhythm into the motion primitives. Our experiment confirmed that our motion analysis yielded motion primitives in accordance to the music rhythm. ER  -},

  abstract = {Jazz and its colorful, expansive history resonate in this unique collection of 60 essays specially-commissioned from today's top jazz performers, writers, and scholars. Contributors include such jazz insiders as Bill Crow, Samuel A. Floyd Jr., Ted Gioia, Gene Lees, Dan Morgenstern, Gunther Schuller, Richard M. Sudhalter, and Patricia Willard. Both a reference book and an engaging read, the Companion surveys the evolution of jazz from its roots in Africa and Europe until the present. Along the way, each distinctive style and period is profiled by an expert in the field. Whether your preference is ragtime, the blues, bebop, or fusion, you will find the chief characteristics and memorable performances illuminated here with a thoroughness found in no other single-volume jazz reference.

The Oxford Companion to Jazz features individual biographies of the most memorable characters of this relatively young art form. Sidney Bechet, King Oliver, Jelly Roll Morton, Louis Armstrong, Bix Beiderbecke, Bessie Smith, Duke Ellington, Coleman Hawkins, Lester Young, Charlie Parker, Miles Davis, Thelonious Monk, Charles Mingus, John Coltrane, and the divas of jazz song--Ella Fitzgerald, Billie Holiday, and Sarah Vaughan--come to life in thoughtful considerations of their influences, often turbulent personal lives, and signature styles. In addition, this book looks at the impact of jazz on American culture-in literature, film, television, and dance-and explores the essential instruments of jazz and their most memorable players.

The Oxford Companion to Jazz will provide a quick reference source as well as a dynamic and broad overview for all lovers of jazz, from novices to aficionados.},

  abstract = {The discovery of events in time series can have important implications, such as identifying microlensing events in astronomical surveys, or changes in a patient's electrocardiogram. Current methods for identifying events require a sliding window of a fixed size, which is not ideal for all applications and could overlook important events. In this work, we develop probability models for calculating the significance of an arbitrary-sized sliding window and use these probabilities to find areas of significance. Because a brute force search of all sliding windows and all window sizes would be computationally intractable, we introduce a method for quickly approximating the results. We apply our method to over 100,000 astronomical time series from the MACHO survey, in which 56 different sections of the sky are considered, each with one or more known events. Our method was able to recover 100\% of these events in the top 1\% of the results, essentially pruning 99\% of the data. Interestingly, our method was able to identify events that do not pass traditional event discovery procedures.},

  abstract = {Much work has been done on cognitive processes and creativity, but there is another half to the picture of creativity -- the affect half. This book addresses that other half by synthesizing the information that exists about affect and creativity and presenting a new model of the role of affect in the creative process. Current information comes from disparate literatures, research traditions, and theoretical approaches. There is a need in the field for a comprehensive framework for understanding and investigating the role of affect in creativity. The model presented here spells out connections between specific affective and cognitive processes important in creativity, and personality traits associated with creativity. 

Identifying common findings and themes in a variety of research studies and descriptions of the creative process, this book integrates child and adult research and the classic psychoanalytic approach to creativity with contemporary social and cognitive psychology. In so doing, it addresses two major questions:
* Is affect an important part of the creative process?
* If it is, then how is affect involved in creative thinking?

In addition, Russ presents her own research program in the area of affect and creativity, and introduces The Affect in Play Scale -- a method of measuring affective expression in children's play -- which can be useful in child psychotherapy and creativity research. Current issues in the creativity area are also discussed, such as artistic versus scientific creativity, adjustment and the creative process, the role of computers in learning about creativity, gender differences in the creative process, and enhancing creativity in home, school, and work settings. Finally, Russ points to future research issues and directions, and discusses alternative research paradigms such as mood-induction methods versus children's play procedures.},

  abstract = {As Oxford's flagship American dictionary, the New Oxford American Dictionary sets the standard of excellence for lexicography in this country. With more than 350,000 words, phrases, and senses, hundreds of explanatory notes, and more than a thousand illustrations, this dictionary provides the most comprehensive and accurate coverage of American English available.

The dictionary draws on the two-billion-word Oxford English Corpus and the unrivaled citation files of the world-renowned Oxford English Dictionary to provide the most accurate and richly descriptive picture of American English ever offered in any dictionary. The Third Edition offers a thoroughly updated text, with revisions throughout and approximately 2,000 new words, phrases, and meanings. Many new words relate to fast-moving areas such as computing, technology, current affairs, and ecology, while others have recently entered the popular lexicon. Usage notes have been updated in light of the most recent Corpus evidence, and a completely new in-text feature on Word Trends charts usage for rapidly changing words and phrases such as carbon, mobile, or tweet. In addition, the volume has an attractive, modern new text design that makes entries easier to read and find.

One of the hallmarks of the New Oxford American Dictionary is the way it reflects the living language. Unlike in more traditional dictionaries, where meanings are ordered chronologically according to the history of the language, each entry plainly shows the principal meaning or meanings of the word, organized by importance in today's English. Thus readers can be confident that the first definition they see is the one most likely to be used by people today, and is not a sense that has been obsolete for two centuries.

Offering clear, authoritative, and precise information, with the in-depth and up-to-date coverage that users need and expect, the New Oxford American Dictionary is the benchmark by which all other American dictionaries are measured.},

  abstract = {Temporal causal modeling can be used to recover the causal structure among a group of relevant time series variables. Several methods have been developed to explicitly construct temporal causal graphical models. However, how to best understand and conceptualize these complicated causal relationships is still an open problem. In this paper, we propose a decomposition approach to simplify the temporal graphical model. Our method clusters time series variables into groups such that strong interactions appear among the variables within each group and weak (or no) interactions exist for cross-group variable pairs. Specifically, we formulate the clustering problem for temporal graphical models as a regression-coefficient sparsification problem and define an interesting objective function which balances the model prediction power and its cluster structure. We introduce an iterative optimization approach utilizing the Quasi-Newton method and generalized ridge regression to minimize the objective function and to produce a clustered temporal graphical model. We also present a novel optimization procedure utilizing a graph theoretical tool based on the maximum weight independent set problem to speed up the Quasi-Newton method for a large number of variables. Finally, our detailed experimental study on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of our methods.},

Following a logical step-by-step format, it defines in turn the nature of God, the mind, human bondage to the emotions, and the power of understanding, moving from a consideration of the eternal to speculate upon humanity's place in the natural order, freedom, and the path to attainable happiness. A powerful work of elegant simplicity, Ethics is a brilliantly insightful consideration of the possibility of redemption through intense thought and philosophical reflection.},

The system has been implemented and tested extensively in performance in the author's opera 'La Quintrala', and experience with its use in practice is presented. Furthermore, the system's functionality is outlined, it is put into current research perspective, and its possibilities for further development and other usages is discussed. The system correlates voice analysis to an underlying chord structure, stored in computer memory. This chord structure defines the primary supportive pitches, and links the notated and electronic score together, addressing the needs of the singer for tonal 'indicators' at any given moment. A computer-generated note is initiated by a combination of the singer - by the onset of a note, or by some element in the continuous spectrum of the singing - and the computer through an accompaniment algorithm. The evolution of this relationship between singer and computer is predefined in the application according to the structural intentions of the score, and is affected by the musical and expressive efforts of the singer. The combination of singer and computer influencing the execution of the accompaniment creates a dynamic, musical interplay between singer and computer, and is a very fertile musical area for a composer's combined computer programming and score writing.},

  abstract = {Recent years have seen a dramatic increase in research and development of scientific workflow systems. These systems promise to make scientists more productive by automating data-driven and compute-intensive analyses. Despite many early achievements, the long-term success of scientific workflow technology critically depends on making these systems useable by ``mere mortals'', i.e., scientists who have a very good idea of the analysis methods they wish to assemble, but who are neither software developers nor scripting-language experts. With these users in mind, we identify a set of desiderata for scientific workflow systems crucial for enabling scientists to model and design the workflows they wish to automate themselves. As a first step towards meeting these requirements, we also show how the collection-oriented modeling and design (comad) approach for scientific workflows, implemented within the Kepler system, can help provide these critical, design-oriented capabilities to scientists.},

The network collected real-time water quality measurements in order to investigate the impacts of current irrigation practice on the environment, in particular underground water salination. Particular challenges included a large coverage area, a sparse network with mean link distances of 800 metres, and strong diurnal and seasonal effects on communications performance. In response we developed protocols that provided high end-to-end packet delivery rate requirements, and hostile deployment environment. We describe the design, implementation, performance and lessons learned for 18 months of remote operation. The results show that the technology has promise for ensuring large-scale sustainable irrigation.},

Most techniques developed so far adopt a finegrained approach to address this issue. In this paper we introduce a novel approach representing entire traces as signals in time. Drawing this analogy between dynamic analysis and signal processing, we are able to access a rich toolkit of well-established and ready-to-use analysis techniques. As an application of this analogy, we show how to fit a visualization of the complete feature space of a system on one page only: our approach visualizes feature traces as time plots, summarizes the trace signals and uses dynamic time warping to group them by similar features. We apply the approach on a case study, and discuss both common and unique patterns as observed on the visualization View full abstract},

The question then shifts from debates over the status of human-like machines, to that of how humans and machines are enacted as similar or different in practice, and with what theoretical, practical and political consequences. Drawing on scholarship across the social sciences, humanities and computing, the author argues for research aimed at tracing the differences within specific sociomaterial arrangements without resorting to essentialist divides. This requires expanding our unit of analysis, while recognizing the inevitable cuts or boundaries through which technological systems are constituted.},

Up to the 19th Century, the function of timbre was primarily related to its identity in addition to being charged with certain effective and symbolic characteristics. The identities of Western instruments are standardized, investing them with a certain neutrality that allows the construction of pitch hierarchies that are unperturbed by differences in timbre of the instruments. For small ensembles, timbre has a stability and a separating power that provides an identification and clarification of form and timbre. The function of timbral identity is one of articulation. With the modern orchestra, the use of instruments is more flexible and their identification becomes more mobile and temporary. Composing the blending of timbres into complex sound-objects follows from the confronting of established sound hierarchies and an enriching of the sound vocabulary. The function of timbr...},

  abstract = {Asynchronous circuit design shows many similarities with software design. This is due to the modular construction style associated with asynchronous circuits, where each asynchronous module can be designed as a standalone object communicating with other modules. We propose a visualisation system for asynchronous circuit design tools, based on clustered graph visualisation and coordinated views. The novelty of our approach is to apply classical software visualisation techniques to a hardware environment and take advantage of properties specific to our asynchronous design flow. This system is based on a control and data flow graph representation of the asynchronous circuit compiled from a high-level description by a syntax-directed transparent process and transferable to the final hardware circuit by a direct synthesis process. Compared to software compilation flows, this transparent design flow offers opportunities for visualisation, with representations at different stages being easily mapped onto each other to combine their visualisation qualities. Each representation also exhibits properties based on some physical attributes of the final hardware circuit, allowing us to render some abstract properties on top of real-world-based ones. This paper shows how the handshake circuit graph is used as the underlying structure onto which properties extracted from other structures are mapped, and then how this structured graph is used as the central piece in a coordinated views environment. These visualisation techniques have been exercised by designers optimising the design of a fully asynchronous ARM processor. View full abstract},

Each atom is a sum of windowed harmonic sinusoidal partials whose relative amplitudes are specific to one instrument, and each molecule consists of several atoms from the same instrument spanning successive time windows. We design efficient algorithms to extract the most prominent atoms or molecules and investigate several applications of this representation, including polyphonic instrument recognition and music visualization.},

  abstract = {In this paper we design coordination policies for a routing problem requiring human-assisted classification of targets through analysis of information gathered on-site by autonomous vehicles. More precisely, we consider the following problem: targets are generated according to a spatio-temporal Poisson process, uniformly in a region of interest. It is desired to classify targets as friends or foes. In order to enable human operators to classify a target, one of the vehicles needs to travel to the target\^{A}{\textquestiondown}s location and gather sufficient information. In other words, the autonomous vehicles provide access to on-site information, and the human operator provide the judgment capabilities necessary to process such information. The objective of our analysis is to design joint motion coordination and operator scheduling policies that minimize the expected time needed to classify a target after its appearance. In addition, we analyze how the achievable system performance depends on the number of autonomous vehicles and of human operators. We present novel coordination policies between the vehicles and operators and compare the performance of these policies with respect to asymptotic performance bounds.},

  abstract = {Timbre is defined as the attribution of spectromorphological identity. Electroacoustic music experience, particularly acousmatic music, questions the viability of a notion of timbre. Of primary significance is the traditional linking of timbre to the source and cause of a sound: the concept of source-cause texture is introduced to define this link. The ambiguous relationship between pitch and timbre indicates that timbre cannot be defined as that part of the sound which is not pitch. Problems in establishing the existence of sonic identities within the musical context, and of maintaining the coherence of identities are discussed, opening up questions relating to musical discourse. Two types of discourse {\textemdash} transformational and typological {\textemdash} are defined, leading to the notion of generic timbre. In a spectromorphological music where defining identities becomes problematic it becomes impossible to disentangle timbre from discourse: here the notion of timbre has a limited viability.},

Following this, beat events are tracked by using a dynamic programming approach, which is updated by using short time tempo estimates. The hybrid decomposition is used in order to calculate the tempo by using different onset detection functions in different frequency bands. In addition, a method that estimates which frequency bands provide reliable periodicities is also presented. The accuracy of the model is evaluated by comparing the presented system against existing approaches using a database of 474 songs.},

Computers watch what happens in a physical space where people are and serve them with meaningful information. Here, most of the systems depend on visual interaction, while there are some other interaction media. In this paper we present a collaborative multimodal system toward spatial presence and perceptual realism of sounds. A two-dimensional sound display called Sound Table is its central component, in which 16 speakers are mounted so that multiple users can have a sensation of ldquosounds are here and thererdquo. A stick-shaped device is provided as a means for interaction with the system. The system recognizes manipulation of the device in a 3D space over Sound Table, and then gives users feedback through visual channel as well as auditory one. ER  -},

  abstract = {The voices in this collection are primarily those of researchers and developers concerned with bringing knowledge of technological possibilities to bear on informed and effective system design. Their efforts are distinguished from many previous writings on system development by their central and abiding reliance on direct and continuous interaction with those who are the ultimate arbiters of system adequacy; namely, those who will use the technology in their everyday lives and work. A key issue throughout is the question of who does what to whom: whose interests are at stake, who initiates action and for what reason, who defines the problem and who decides that there is one. 

The papers presented follow in the footsteps of a small but growing international community of scholars and practitioners of participatory systems design. Many of the original European perspectives are represented here as well as some new and distinctively American approaches. The collection is characterized by a rich and diverse set of perspectives and experiences that, despite their differences, share a distinctive spirit and direction -- a more humane, creative, and effective relationship between those involved in technology's design and use, and between technology and the human activities that motivate the technology.},

  abstract = {Many humanities scholars are working to transform their disciplines in response to new conditions and problems emerging in the twenty-first century. Arguably, two of the most important forces affecting contemporary global culture are the growing awareness of the ecological crisis and the proliferation of digital media. This essay endeavors to develop Felix Guattari's ``unfinished'' concept of ecosophy into a theoretical framework for constructing productive syntheses between the ecological and the digital. In general, the essay first articulates ecosophical models of individual and collective subjectivity, and then argues that the best way to sustain ecosophical identity experience is to invent ``post-media'' practices, which harness the networked infrastructure of digital media such that specific pedagogical engagements with the technology effectively maximise the user's capacity to affect and be affected by immanent forces in the world. In addition, this Guattarian rethinking of the ecological turn concurrently challenges the philosophical basis of the pedagogy of Nature appreciation that has characterised the eco-humanities landscape since the 1970s. The essay's conclusions gesture toward a transversal eco-humanities, which would be rhizomatically rooted in Guattari's preference for autopoiesis and becoming-other (via new media), rather than a static allegiance to the ideals of ``Self-realisation'' postulated by the deep ecology movement.},

As with "ordinary" time series, the data analyst is faced with the same problems of modeling, estimation, model checking, diagnostics and prediction. The present work shows that these questions can be attacked by means of regression theory for categorical time series whose foundation is based on generalized linear models and partial likelihood inference. A variety of models are provided to illustrate the selection of the link function and recent large sample results are reviewed. The theory is developed without resorting to the Markov assumption and to the notion of stationarity. Moreover, regression methods for categorical time series allow for parsimonious modeling and incorporation of random time-dependent covariates as opposed to other procedures. In particular, nominal and ordinal time series are analyzed and compared empirically to Markov chains and mixture transition distribution models.},

This thesis presents a new approach to playing physical models, based on multidimensional signals. Its focus is on the long-term research question, ``How can we make a computer mediated instrument with control intimacy equal to the most expressive acoustic instruments?'' In the material world, the control and sounding properties of an instrument or other object are intimately linked by the object's construction. Multidimensional signals, used as connections between a gestural controller and a physical model, can in principle provide the same intimacy. This work presents a new, low-cost sensor design capable of generating a 2D force signal, a new implementation of the 2D digital waveguide mesh, and two experimental computer music instruments that combine these components using different metaphors. The new instruments are evaluated in terms of intimacy, playability and plausibility. Multidimensional connections between sensors and a physical model are found to facilitate a high degree of control intimacy, and to reproduce as emergent behavior some important phenomena associated with acoustic instruments.},

  abstract = {Abstract Adjoint models are powerful tools for many studies that require an estimate of sensitivity of model output (e.g., a forecast) with respect to input. Actual fields of sensitivity are produced directly and efficiently, which can then be used in a variety of applications, including data assimilation, parameter estimation, stability analysis, and synoptic studies. The use of adjoint models as tools for sensitivity analysis is described here using some simple mathematics. An example of sensitivity fields is presented along with a short description of adjoint applications. Limitations of the applications are discussed and some speculations about the future of adjoint models are offered.},

Real-time implementation of the algorithms is available in the EyesWeb XMI social signal processing library. Applications of the approach is in user centric media and in particular in active music listening (EUICT FP7 Project SAME).},

  abstract = {A popular technique to design variable fractional delay (VFD) filters or variable bandedge filters is the polynomial based finite impulse response (FIR) filters, where each filter coefficient is approximated as a polynomial of the variable parameter. However, if the filter is required to have both VFD and variable bandedge, the computational complexity becomes very high, because two-dimensional polynomials have to be used, provided that the same polynomial idea is followed. In this paper, a filter bank approach is proposed for the design of VFD filters. The basic idea of the approach is to split the full band signals into subbands and each subband is, respectively, shifted by a phase, which is determined by the required fractional delay. The overall fractional delay is achieved by combining all subbands. Using this technique, the variable bandedge could be incorporated into the VFD filter with trivial extra computations. Design examples show that the proposed technique achieves high performance with low computational complexity. View full abstract},

With it have come vast amounts of data in a variety of fields such as medicine, biology, finance, and marketing. The challenge of understanding these data has led to the development of new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such as data mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these tools have common underpinnings but are often expressed with different terminology. This book describes the important ideas in these areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical, the emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberal use of color graphics. It is a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interested in data mining in science or industry. The book's coverage is broad, from supervised learning (prediction) to unsupervised learning. The many topics include neural networks, support vector machines, classification trees and boosting---the first comprehensive treatment of this topic in any book. This major new edition features many topics not covered in the original, including graphical models, random forests, ensemble methods, least angle regression \& path algorithms for the lasso, non-negative matrix factorization, and spectral clustering. There is also a chapter on methods for ``wide'' data (p bigger than n), including multiple testing and false discovery rates.},

  abstract = {Concatenative sound synthesis is a promising method of musical sound synthesis with a steady stream of work and publications for over five years now. This article offers a comparative survey and taxonomy of the many different approaches to concatenative synthesis throughout the history of electronic music, starting in the 1950s, even if they weren't known as such at their time, up to the recent surge of contemporary methods. Concatenative sound synthesis methods use a large database of source sounds, segmented into units , and a unit selection algorithm that finds the units that match best the sound or musical phrase to be synthesized, called the target . The selection is performed according to the descriptors of the units. These are characteristics extracted from the source sounds, e.g. pitch, or attributed to them, e.g. instrument class. The selected units are then transformed to fully match the target specification, and concatenated. However, if the database is sufficiently large, the probability is high that a matching unit will be found, so the need to apply transformations is reduced. The most urgent and interesting problems for further work on concatenative synthesis are listed concerning segmentation, descriptors, efficiency, legality, data mining and real time interaction. Finally, the conclusion tries to provide some insight into the current and future state of concatenative synthesis research.},

Key functionalities that a home service robot must provide are localization, navigation, object recognition and object handling. A considerable amount of research has been conducted to make the service robot perform these operations with its own sensors, actuators and a knowledge database. With all heavy sensors, actuators and a database, the robot could have performed the given tasks in a limited environment or showed the limited capabilities in a natural environment. We initiated a smart home environment project for light-weight service robots to provide reliable services by interacting with the environment through the wireless sensor networks. This environment consists of the following three main components: smart objects with an radio frequency identification (RFID) tag and smart appliances with sensor network functionality; the home server that connects smart devices as well as maintains information for reliable services; and the service robots that perform tasks in collaboration with the environment. In this paper, we introduce various types of smart devices which are developed for assisting the robot by providing sensing and actuation, and present our approach on the integration of these devices to construct the smart home environment. Finally, we discuss the future directions of our project.},

Our goal was to check the existence in these patterns of both task-related differences (e.g. listening to music vs. rest) and training-related differences (musicians vs. non-musicians). For this purpose, a non-linear measure, called similarity index (S.I.), was used to detect asymmetric interdependencies between different brain regions by means of EEG signals. Relatively active and passive regions of the brain were found where the degree of activity was represented by excited degrees of freedom. The S.I. obtained during listening to different kinds of music was compared statistically with the S.I. with eyes closed, and significant changes (P\ensuremath{<} or = 0.05) were entered into schematic brain maps. A topographical representation of the S.I. yielded differences in the interdependency while performing different cognitive tasks. The results demonstrate the occurrence of task-related differences in both groups of subjects. Furthermore, subjects with musical training possessed significantly higher degrees of interdependencies than such without musical training while listening to music but not to text. We conclude that the new measure can be successfully applied for studying the dynamical co-operation between cortical areas during higher cognitive functioning.},

This pattern, discernible even in such an inconspicuous action as switching on a stereo, has global effects: it sharply divides life into labor and leisure, it sustains the industrial democracies, and it fosters the view that the earth itself is a technological device. He argues that technology has served us as well in conquering hunger and disease, but that when we turn to it for richer experiences, it leads instead to a life dominated by effortless and thoughtless consumption. Borgmann does not reject technology but calls for public conversation about the nature of the good life. He counsels us to make room in a technological age for matters of ultimate concern{\textemdash}things and practices that engage us in their own right.},

  abstract = {Computer science as an engineering discipline has been spectacularly successful. Yet it is also a philosophical enterprise in the way it represents the world and creates and manipulates models of reality, people, and action. In this book, Paul Dourish addresses the philosophical bases of human-computer interaction. He looks at how what he calls "embodied interaction" -- an approach to interacting with software systems that emphasizes skilled, engaged practice rather than disembodied rationality -- reflects the phenomenological approaches of Martin Heidegger, Ludwig Wittgenstein, and other twentieth-century philosophers. The phenomenological tradition emphasizes the primacy of natural practice over abstract cognition in everyday activity. Dourish shows how this perspective can shed light on the foundational underpinnings of current research on embodied interaction. He looks in particular at how tangible and social approaches to interaction are related, how they can be used to analyze and understand embodied interaction, and how they could affect the design of future interactive systems.},

It has only been within the last ten years that reverse engineering, or "program comprehension", has grown into the current sub-discipline of software engineering. Traditional software engineering is primarily focused on the development and design of new software. However, most programmers work on software that other people have designed and developed. Up to 50\% of a software maintainers time can be spent determining the intent of source code. The growing demand to reevaluate and reimplement legacy software systems, brought on by the proliferation of clientserver and World Wide Web technologies, has underscored the need for reverse engineering tools and techniques. This paper introduces the terminology of reverse engineering and gives some of the obstacles that make reverse engineering difficult. Although reverse engineering remains heavily dependent on the human component, a number of automated tools are presented that aid the reverse engineer.},

  abstract = {Emerging over the past ten years from a set of post-structuralist theoretical lineages, non-representational theories are having a major impact both within and outside of the human geography discipline. This non-representational theorization and research has opened up new sets of problematics around practice and performativity while also inspiring new ways of doing and writing human geography that aim to engage with the taking-place of everyday life. Written in a clear and accessible style and drawing together a range of innovative contributions from leading writers, this the first book to provide an extensive and in-depth overview of non-representational theories and human geography. Each contributor has been selected to address a specific theme and provide a unique perspective on the current state of non-representational theories. It includes interventions by those at the 'centre' of the movement as well as emergent voices. In doing so, it addresses the core concerns and themes of what appears as a disparate field of research, demonstrates the widespread impact, both actual and potential, for many aspects of human geographic thought and practice, and highlights areas of emergent critical debate and discussion within non-representational theories. It is structured around four thematic sections - Life, Representation, Ethics and Politics - which explore the varied relations that non-representational theories have with contemporary human geography.},

  abstract = {Python is a popular dynamic language with a large part of its appeal coming from powerful libraries and extension modules. These augment the language and make it a productive environment for a wide variety of tasks, ranging from web development (Django) to numerical analysis (NumPy). Unfortunately, Python's performance is quite poor when compared to modern implementations of languages such as Lua and JavaScript. Why does Python lag so far behind these other languages? As we show, the very same API and extension libraries that make Python a powerful language also make it very difficult to efficiently execute. Given that we want to retain access to the great extension libraries that already exist for Python, how fast can we make it? To evaluate this, we designed and implemented Falcon, a high-performance bytecode interpreter fully compatible with the standard CPython interpreter. Falcon applies a number of well known optimizations and introduces several new techniques to speed up execution of Python bytecode. In our evaluation, we found Falcon an average of 25\% faster than the standard Python interpreter on most benchmarks and in some cases about 2.5X faster.},

  abstract = {At Philips Research Laboratories Aachen we have found a way to reconfigure software in embedded systems like, for example, switches or set top boxes. The goal of the reconfiguration is to repair software faults and to update software functionality. This should be done on-the-fly without decreasing the system's availability which means during the on-going operation of the system. The developed approach is based on available distributed operating system technology (Chorus) and on a widely used family of programming languages (C/C++). It does not require changes in the operating system nor in the development system. All needed adaptations are done in the application. However, it was our goal to keep the development of the application functionality separated from the creation of the replaceability. An application is made replaceable through some systematic changes which can be done automatically. Some additional effort is still needed. This paper describes the mechanisms developed for that purpose. As a reconfiguration unit we have chosen a Chorus actor which is a kind of a multi-threaded process. We describe how to make such a process replaceable. Finally, we give some performance figures to show the efficiency of the implemented algorithms. View full abstract},
