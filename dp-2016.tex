\subsubsection*{PROJECT TITLE}

A few options:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Live <domain-specific> visual programming for complex
    data analytics software}
\item \textbf{Bringing interactivity to high-performance scientific
    computing}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{AIMS AND BACKGROUND}

\paragraph{Aims}

The modern world is saturated with computing power, with contemporary
smart phones outperforming the original Cray~1 supercomputer by three
orders of magnitude. Advances in network connectivity and bandwidth
have also made it easier to harness remote computing power---giving
rise to the almost limitless potential of the ``cloud'' for processing
and storing data from anywhere in the world. In short, accessing
supercomputer-level \textbf{performance} has never been easier.

Modern computing devices are also spectacularly \textbf{interactive},
enabling users to slide, tap, watch, speak, listen with real-time
feedback. The benefits of interactivity in programming (while long
espoused by lisp programmers) have in more recent times gained more
widespread acceptance, through Agile\parencite{Fowler2001} and
eXtreme\parencite{Beck1999} programming practices, and the emerging
field of live programming\parencite{Swift2013b}.

But is all of this power, interactivity and networked connectivity
working together to tackle cutting-edge computing challenges of the
21st century? Consider the following scenarios:
\begin{enumerate}
\item A computational physicist submits a job to the supercomputer
  which takes 3 weeks to execute. During subsequent data analysis, it
  she discovers that there was an incompatibility in the
  specifications of 2 parameters (out of 200) in the input deck for
  this simulation, which caused the computation to fail to converge.
  The convergence issue is clearly visible in even a text-only dump of
  high-level simulation quantities at each timestep.

% \item a bioinformatics researcher trawls through millions of generated
%   phylogenic candidates in order to match and develop evolutionary
%   trees. A subsequent analysis of the results finds that the stopping
%   criteria were satisfied after only the first hundered such files had
%   been compared.

\item A team of SES personnel are monitoring a real-time satellite
  feed of a bushfire which is hours away from threatening homes and
  lives. A computational simulation of the bushfire is being performed
  to predict the future progress of the firefront, but over time the
  simulation gives unreliable results---the SES experts deduce that
  the model is underestimating the fuel load in the region. The change
  to the model to account for the increased fuel load is not a complex
  one, but the simulation system has not been designed to allow such
  changes while the simulation is running, and restarting the system
  with an updated model takes more time than is anticipated before the
  firefront reaches the housing line.

\item A growing hi-tech manufacturing company has historically relied
  on managing their supply chain by hand. However, as the company
  grows and the number of supplier relationships increases this is no
  longer feasible. A purely automated approach generates suboptimal
  results, because the supply chain involves a complex network of
  human relationships and hand-shake agreements between the suppliers.
  The expert team can see subtle problems with the results (and
  appropriate subtle corrections) as the automated model is running,
  but are prevented by the software from effecting these changes until
  the model has finished running.
\end{enumerate}

These scenarios, and many others, could benefit from a tighter
coupling between the human researchers and their data analytics
software \emph{at run time}. Such enhanced human-in-the-loop (HIL)
workflows are now possible in ways that been hitherto unimaginable.

The aim of this project is to bring human-in-the-loop interactivity to
complex data analysis software workflows, enabling scientists,
programmers and domain experts to take gain new insights into data and
take better advantage of the modern computing and data landscape.

% \begin{itemize}
% \item in a data-centric world, we need lots of big data-oriented
%   software incl data processing and visualisation
% \item current techniques include BI software, data mining/machine
%   learning software, scientific software, social media analysis
%   software \ldots
% \item sorts of things we want to answer include compute behaviours of
%   new materials (science); find important trends (business); learn
%   about phenomenon (social sciences); discover relationships
%   (statistics); \ldots
% \item these not well-addressed by current solutions. We need: more
%   involvement of end users in specifying and realising solutions;
%   better way to model the analysis workflow ; more abstract and visual
%   way to specify and generate complex data analysis algorithms and
%   code ; live update of complex analysis software from visual models ;
%   visualisations of parts and whole large data sets ; live update of
%   visualisations as change visual specifications for interactive
%   feedback to users
% \end{itemize}

\paragraph{Background}


Although there are some disagreements about what exactly constitutes
``Big Data''\parencite{TODO}, there are clearly opportunities to 

revolution is gathering steam, despite the 



In 2007, Gil et~al. \parencite{Gil2007} outlined several outstanding
challenges in scientific computation and data analysis. These included data
provenance (where data comes from), reproducibility and shareability
of complex data processing software pipelines, and the need for dyna

Due to a combination of technical and social factors, scientific
computing is still largely a batch-compile-run-analyse workflow, and
although there have been calls for more
interactivity\parencite{Gil2007} support for this workflow is very
limited at present\parencite{Mattoso}.

Different mobs are already coming at this problem from different angles

Workflows: bottom-up, or top-down?

% BACKGROUND

% - live programming
% - live programming applications to date
% - HPC software
% - Data mining \& Machine learning software
% - BI software
% - DSLs, DSVLs ; applied to above
% - information visualisation
% - live infoVis


\subsubsection*{RESEARCH PROJECT}

Computational steering: how's that working out for you?

% Want to bring the idea of "liveness" to HPC/big data software â€“ allow
% developers to get rapid, incremental update of target data process
% algs ; allow developers to get near-instantaneous feedback on input of
% changes to outputs data via rich visualisations

% Want to leverage domain-specific visual languages to specify these big
% data analysis problems to enable end users a high-level, controlled
% environment c.f. R-type scripting, code, BI configs etc

% Want to leverage rich information visualisations to provide small
% snapshot and overall output understanding by end users

% << Worth a big picture "concept diagram" here >>

% The aim of this project is thus to invent a new approach to specifying
% and realizing data-centric software systems using live visual
% programming and data visualisation we break into specific aims:

% - SDL++ for data analytics
% - Live visual programming of data analytics - DSVLs
% - extempore -> live update of GPU/HPC/IR/ML algs etc
% - live visualisations of complex data analytics alg data for feedback,
%   output
% - evaluate effectiveness by apply to several exemplars e.g. particles,
%   big data analysis, infoVis...

\paragraph{Research significance}

Big data software, HPC software becoming massively important
Development of both still rudimentary, limited use of "liveness"
concept in HPC/DSVLs to date (some in InfoVis). Many applications of
our approach; a very enabling technology. Examples might include\ldots

\paragraph{Advancing the knowledge base with innovation}

\begin{itemize}
\item very limited use of "liveness" concept to date in BI, HPC, etc ;
  adding into these very novel
\item limited DSVLs leveraged to date in these domains ; enables end
  users
\item InfoVis well studied but specification low-level, limited ;
  enables greater generality
\item running the concept of "liveness" through these: DSVLs <->
  HPC/Big Data code <-> InfoVis
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{Conceptual framework}

explore \rightarrow enliven \rightarrow empower

Series of research problems to be solved:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Add ability to modify HPC/Big Data code while
  running---"liveness"
\item Invent set of DSVLs for specifying such applications
\item Use DSVLs to generate code / modify code (via 2, 1 above)
\item Specifying rich, live InfoVis solution for data processed (by 1
  above)
\item Evaluate effectivess on set of exemplars
